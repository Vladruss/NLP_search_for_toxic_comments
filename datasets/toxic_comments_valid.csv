 Blocking Mardyks (2012) 

Excellent work there Shii. We can't have his kind getting us to think about what the Maya actually say about their own prophecies. We insulted him, offended him and abused him and he just had to be ethical and persistant. BLOCK those Mother Fukkers!!! Taking out the entire Santa Fe Public Library system is a great preemptive strike also. There may be others of his kind, that sympathize with those """"Indians"""". These people actually LOVE the Earth and that is without reliable sources! We kicked their asses and have the right to write THEIR history and interpret THEIR sacred teachings however we please. We need more from college students who have been indoctrinated in the Church of Academia. That piece by Stitler is one of the most exaggerated and opinionated and so yeah, use that as the title of the page! And by all means give John MAJOR Jenkins his own section. Not a single scholar or Mayanist agrees with his appropriated theory and this kind of hypocrisy and arrogance is what Wiki is all about. We can get away with it, by continuing to use our power to censor free thinkers like Mardyks and his kind. Sony Pictures is paying us all off with tickets, so let us know how many you want. FREE popcorn, too! Whoopee! Best wishes from Jimini Cricket 97.123.26.228  """,1

Hello again, Tdadamemd. Getting right to your comment about slang, I don't understand your stating that """"fuck"""" is not slang, or your linking to dictionary.com as proof that it is not. The word """"fuck,"""" while vulgar, is also slang; the dictionary.com source you cited even states so. It makes it clear that it can be slang for a variety of things, including sexual intercourse/other sexual activity. It list 13 numbered examples regarding what """"fuck"""" can mean. As for Wiktionary, I don't refer to sources like that. And, yes, I am fine with mentioning """"fuck"""" (or """"fucking"""") and the euphemism """"sleeping together"""" lower in the article, in the the Definitions and stimulation factors section, as alternative words for sexual intercourse/sexual activity. But again, there are a lot of terms for sexual intercourse, most of them slang. That these terms exist doesn't mean that all of them should be in this article. In fact, most times when there are many alternative terms for a word, especially if those terms are slang, we don't include all of them. As you know, this is an encyclopedia and not a dictionary. 

If WP:CONSENSUS is achieved for including your proposal, I'll add it by briefly summarizing that there are various vulgar and/or slang terms and euphemisms for sexual intercourse/other sexual activity...such as """"fuck"""" and """"sleeping together"""" (the wording won't be exactly like that, of course). And, really, because there are so many terms for sexual intercourse, and """"fuck"""" is not especially relevant to the topic of sexual intercourse (by that, I mean that most people and sources are not discussing the word """"fuck"""" when discussing sexual intercourse), that is probably why """"fuck"""" isn't currently in this article. Someone who is aware of your having repeatedly added it to the lead expressed to me via email me that """"fuck"""" is also U.S.-centric; so that's also something to think about, though the term is also used outside of the United States. 

Also, sexual intercourse does not = fuck. It's that fuck = sexual intercourse; in its literal sense anyway, since when people use the term...they are usually using it as profanity. That is also why I told you """"The Fuck article mentions sexual intercourse in its lead because it is especially relevant to the topic. However, the term 'fuck' is not especially relevant to the topic of sexual intercourse."""" 

I cannot see how this article is broken simply because it doesn't currently include """"fuck."""" But, like I stated, I don't mind adding it to the article. I'd rather see what others have to state on that matter first, however.   """,1

As a Conservative I think we need to LIONIZE Senator Kerry   
-    
- I think we need to add a section APPLAUDING Kerry's DENIGRATING AND INSULTING cheap shot insults directed at our brave soldiers in Iraq.   
-    
- After all, Senator Kerry just insured that conservatives will maintain control of both the House AND Sentate this year with his DESPICABLE comments.   
-    
- My DEEPEST condolences to Kerry apologists and liberal editors at Wikipedia (in other words, AT LEAST 90% of you.)   
-    
- In 2004, the dems and their LIBERAL enablers at MSNBCCBSNBCNPRPBSABCREUTERS/AP wanted the election to be about Viet Nam, figuring it gave Kerry an edge. So they made it about VNam and thanks to our BRAVE HONEST HEROIC Swift Boat Vets for Truth, it was! LOL! (With additional props to Dan Rather.)   
-    
- In 2006, the dems and their liberal enablers at MSNBCCBSNBCNPRPBSABCREUTERS/AP wanted the election to be about Iraq figuring it gave Dems an edge.   
-    
- And thanks to Senator John Kerry, the Dan Rather of 2006, this year's election is about Iraq.    
-    
- Except not quite the way they intended. LOL!!!   
-    
-    
-    
- And no, saying it was 'joke' just won't cut it.    
-    
- This latest Kerry outrage totally fits the LONGSTANDING pattern of Dems hating and denigrating our troops. From Kerry's GI Joe outfit testimony before Congress in 1971 to Dennis Kucinich, to Howard Dean to a San Francisco (where Nancy Pelosi is from) supervisor saying we should SHUT DOWN our military, the antipathy is indelible.   
-    
- And saying, 'Hey! I wasn't trying to insult our troops, just our Commander in Chief!'   
- only makes it worse. The American Legion certainly isn't buying it.

- Perhaps you liberal wikipedia editors want to attack them too!

 PLEASE READ BEFORE ADDING ANY MORE RUBBISH 

As far as I can see Wikipedia has become a very turgid shadow of what I originally signed up to - and I really can't see any point editing it any more.

Having followed the climate articles for many years and now having a great deal of expertise, I can no longer just sit back and hope that Wikipedia will some day come around to a NPOV. There are certain simple things that are so obviously POV pushing that it beggars belief that they still go on: 

Not using common names when they are used by everyone else
Not admitting simple facts like it is not currently warming.
Pretending """"global warming"""" is a """"scientific"""" issue when everyone knows it is mainly political rhetoric even when practised by the """"scientists"""".

And don't you dare think I'm pushing POV - I have not once added anything to a climate article without first seeking consensus (which basically means I have never edited a climate article)!!!!

I KNOW WHAT IS A NPOV ... BECAUSE I HAVEN'T FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED FROM WHEN I USED TO BE A GLOBAL WARMING ADVOCATE AND NEITHER HAVE MY VIEWS ON THE ENVIRONMENT CHANGED ... I JUST CAN'T STAND PEOPLE BEING DISHONEST, AND I JUST THINK SCIENTIFIC INTEGRITY IS MORE IMPORTANT THAT ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS

From the day I first tried to get a NPOV on the climate articles (when I used to work in wind and was openly saying global warming is happening) till today, I haven't once managed to get a substantial change toward NPOV into a climate article. '''I'm angry ... not because I f*cking wanted to put the sceptical view ... it is because you bunch of pr***s have turned me into a sceptic because you refuse to see the obvious POV pushing that has been going on.

And the great consolation, is that the climate articles have been so POV that most decent people can spot it a mile off and what with climategate, the propaganda in Wikipedia is no longer considered a reliable source.   """,1

 False inormation in the article 
As you would expect, the propagandists would say and do everything to mislead us. They once again proved themselfs to be the proven LIARS we alreayd knew they were since the article wrongly states that the darker picture with the """"fall-off"""" effects is the edited one, which is pure BS.

The original photo is the one with the """"fall-off"""" effect which was printed in The West Australian already back in august 2, 1969 (~6 min in this clip http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMuTiziCszU) while the lighten up picture is the EDITED version who came out much later. So unless the propaganda trolls cant find a version of THEIR claimed original version dated EARLIER than august second 1969, i suggest them to SHUTUP.

Proven fake: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Aldrin_Apollo_11_original.jpg/179px-Aldrin_Apollo_11_original.jpg

Youtube is not a reliable source for information about a conspiracy theory. Is there a reliable source available that supports your claim?   

 The Buzz Alrdin photo is explained at Examination_of_Apollo_Moon_photographs#Issues with crosshairs in photos.   You talkin' to me? 

The video shows a guy holding up the actual newspaper from 2 aug 1969 to prove that the """"fall-off"""" picture is how the original one looked like, but then its youtube who isnt a reliable source!?  your desperate try for making a point is laughable... but i wouldnt expect more from a propaganda TROLL.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 91.145.38.53   

 No, that newspaper doesn't show what the original one looks like.  The original is a transparency that is in NASA's vaults.  They made prints that were widely reprinted. See this for more information.  You talkin' to me? 

Bullshit! excuses from NASA wont make it true! you have the history of that picture in the video i linked to and even the NASA site you linked to shows the fact that the darker picture is the first one, the original from 1969, while the more lighten edited version came out 1975. So why you arguing? you dont have a chance here. As i said, BRING UP a picture dated earlier than 2 aug 1969 or SHUTUP - its that simple!

91.145.38.53, please stop insulting other editors and please sign your posts, just put four tildes at the end .   

I dont tolerating having my talk session closed, this is what the propagandists do? censoring their opponents!
Unless the propagandists cant bring up the picture THEY claim to be the original together with a date which needs to be earlier than second of august 1969, i will change the article. False misleading information should never be tolerated! Its already proven that the """"fall-off"""" darker version IS the original. If anyone wants to argue, then bring up! 91.145.38.53  

 The propaganda liars 
This article is beyond laughable! Since the propagandists trash talking and like to """"debunk"""" ppl like Bart Sibrel, Ralph Rene, and Bill Kaysing (with no evidence to debunk them, however) we should debunk the LIARS the propagandists listen to!  """"youtube is not a reliable source"""" the propagandists says... still they link to youtube videos themselfs to suit their false propaganda in a desperate act to try prove THEIR laughable points. So if they can link to youtube videos, i will do the same just to prove that THEIR sources are nothing else than FALSE PROPAGANDA. Using proven liars like Jay Windley, Phil Plait, and Svectors youtube series as some kinda evidence is laughable.  I think that these trolls needs their own section! lets see what kinda ppl who is behind the sites that the propagandists always links to. Its time to face their cl",1

Although he only did it as he knew reporting me to SPI would have probably brought him to much attention - at that stage he was still trying to keep the whole thing quiet, as it obviously benefited him. Not that he need have worried - every admin that ever responded to him, either at SPI or AIV, took the exact same view of my socking as as you espouse here (although obviously some were motivated by more than just incompetence). As such, it's likely your report to AIV is only going to ensure their names don't get picked up and the systems/attitudes/culture that cause this obviously counter-productive reaction don't get fixed - meaning that Werieth might as well try his arm at another return later. It speaks volumes that you'd think reverting me was remotely a good thing, even though in that very same ANI there's an arb explaining how he could have probably picked up on this whole thing much earlier if it wasn't for just that sort of mindless cycle of reversion and blocking of obvious socks, on the basis all socking is ebil.

THE USED WORDS OPENLY MAKE THIS ARTICLE A VERY BIASED ONE

I would like the person who wrote the line that """"an increasing number(!) of Turkish intellectuals"""" support the genocide THAT HE SHOW SOME REFERENCE and PROOF.  Also the SO-CALLED fact that over a million Armenians are killed IS A VERY DUBIOUS ONE AND REQUIRES SOME PROOF. WHAT MAKES WIKIPEDIA, WIKIPEDIA IS THE FACT THAT EVEN IN THE CASE OF A TRAGEDY AS IMMENSE AS 9/11, IT PRESERVES ITS NEUTRALITY. HOW CAN YOU CALL THIS ARTICLE NEUTRAL IF IT SMELLS HEAVILY BIASED? For example the VERY IMPORTANT START PARAPGRAPH SHOULD BE MODIFIED  LIKE , SAY 

"""" It is also alleged that over a million Armenians were killed during the relocation etc...."""" 

OTHERWISE;  you have to show immediate references or supporting articles, proofs etc. I would like to receive those proofs, if this is really a documented proof, I very much would like to read them.  
PLEASE REFER TO SOME RESPECTED ENCYCLOPEDIA LIKE BRITTANICA ABOUT THE SO-CALLED ARMENIAN GENOCIDE, TO SEE WHAT NEUTRALITY REALLY MEANS !

No academic research , conducted in Turkish Republic, ever denies the fact that """"MANY"""" Armenians were killed during the relocation but """"A MILLION"""" IS REALLY A BAD EXAGGERATE.

Just because there are some PUNKS ( Do they call themselves System of Something? ) who make their homeland's propaganda, does not mean that you can falsify the history.

PLEASE REFER TO THE RESPECTED HISTORIANS( MANY OF THEM ARE NOT TURKISH) WHO DENY THE SO-CALLED GENOCIDE...

I WOULD LIKE THE PEOPLE WHO CONTROL THIS SITE, CHANGE THESE BIASED LINES IMMEDIATELY.

Oh, and here is the response I posted, that got erased: 

REDVEЯS, I do not feel my comments are poisonous. Other people agree with me. The """"good editor"""" you describe is often very harsh in his dealings with others and seems to put his own personal pride ahead of common sense when he prevents pictures other than his from being used. As far as I know, most people on Wikipedia conceal their true identities including David Shankbone and yourself. To be called cowardly for merely highlighting the anonymity we all use is ridiculous. You say my criticism of David Shankbone is disgusting. What I find disgusting are his insensitive, uncaring, and simply awful author photos, and the egotistical ways he defends them.
And here is my response to you, David Shankbone: There's a difference between attending a public event and expecting a photo to appear for one day in a local newspaper, vs. having that event define your permanent image on a site as widely used as Wikipedia. Your animosity toward authors demonstrates your own lack of a NPOV. Your history with Sharyn November is more complicated than you describe. She at first repeatedly tried to take down the photo you took of her (as anyone can see in the history of her page), and it wasn't until you used intimidation (on a talk page I think, by implying she shouldn't even be writing on her page due to neutral point of view issues and might be blocked) that she immediately backed down and got friendly, clearly out of fear that you would block her. —Preceding unsigned comment added by Anonymous 374 (talk • contribs) """,1

In 1894 Nicolas Notovitch a politically motivated person manufactured a lie that Jesus was in India. Subsequently a 15th century tomb of a Muslim was Yuz Asaf the tomb of Jesus. Documents were fabricated by Prof.Yasin and then Fida Hassnain a pseudo historian joined in and this agenda was pushed. No authentic Hindu scripture has anything to do with semiticism in any manner.",1

"""STOP DELETING MY ADDITION!  You, Muboshgu/Mephistophelian say:

Please do not use talk pages ... for general discussion of the topic. They are
for discussion related to improving the article. They are not to be used as a
forum or chat. If you continue to use talk pages as you do, you may be blocked
from editing. You are using the talk page to push a POV rather than addressing
the article in a constructive manner. Please stop.

I AM NOT """"generally discussing a topic"""", I AM NOT """"chatting"""". I AM NOT
""""pushing a P.O.V."""".  If you do not understand basic English grammar, you have
no business telling me anything.  FACT: commas are used in this context to
separate a list, a series, of related clauses.  Grammar is not a matter of a
""""general discussion"""" or """"chatting"""" or a """"point of view"""".  It is a technically
precise set of rules, and in this case, a set of rules that demonstrate that
the foundation of the issue is a fraud.  THIS IS NOT OPINION, IT IS FACT, IT
IS RELEVANT TO THE ARTICLE, IT IS FOUNDATIONAL TO THE ARTICLE.  I AM TALKING
ABOUT IMPROVING THE ARTICLE BY CLARIFYING THE FOUNDATION ACCORDING TO THE
RULES OF ENGLISH GRAMMAR AS ANY LITERATE PERSON CAN SEE.  AND I AM TALKING
ABOUT ADDING THE RELEVANT AND FOUNDATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL CLAUSE.

FROM TALK GUIDELINES (why don't you review them!):

 There is reasonable allowance for speculation, suggestion, and personal
knowledge on talk pages, with a view to prompting further investigation.

 make the extra effort so that other people understand you. Being
friendly is a great help.

 It is always a good idea to explain your views; it is less helpful for you to
voice an opinion on something and not explain why you hold it.

 Article talk pages should be used to discuss ways to improve an article;

 Deal with facts

 The talk page can be used to """"park"""" material removed from the article due to
verification or other concerns, while references are sought or concerns
discussed.

 The talk page is particularly useful to talk about edits.

 New proposals for the article can be put forward for discussion
by other editors if you wish.

 Do not threaten people: For example, ...
having them banned for disagreeing with you.

 removing others' comments is sometimes allowed.
But you should ... stop if there is any objection.

As I previously posted here: THE ARTICLE SHOULD BE IMPROVED by making it clear
in the opening statement that the entire issue is a fraud upon the public
since there is no """"natural born citizen"""" requirement that is applicable today.
That is fundamental to an informative relevant foundation to the article, not
a matter of opinion, and a matter of grammatical fact.

If I say """"No animal except a mouse, or a rat, at the time I give the signal,
shall be captured"""", then I am saying only mice and rats shall be captured AT
THE TIME I GIVE THE SIGNAL.  My order has no validity at any other point in
time.  Similarly, the requirement for """"natural born citizen"""" only applied AT
THE TIME OF THE ADOPTION OF THIS CONSTITUTION.  It does not apply today, and
the following clause should be part of the article, since it is the clause at
the foundation of the issue in the article:

No person except a natural born Citizen, or a
Citizen of the United States, at the time of the
Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible
to the Office of President; neither shall any
person be eligible to that Office who shall not
have attained to the Age of thirty five Years, and
been fourteen Years a Resident within the United
States.

Again, you disgusting cretin, you accuse my statements of being laughable, yet have no logical basis to believe so. You think I believe my arguments are gospel, eh? So you're the kind of person who believes that if everybody believes something, then you should go along with them? So you're the kind of sick bastard that would've condoned slavery just because everybody you knew did? I do not at all think my arguments are gospel, I just proudly stand by my word until a logical argument will present a sensical contradiction. You're the bastard who has some sort of personal agenda attatched to this and for some reason or another, you refuse to have it changed, like a no-good dirty hippocrite.

Dude, sorry for the rough language, but you are one fucking dumbass idiot. Everything I type is extremely intelligible and free-flowing, if you will, yet you seem to interpret it WAY differently than it is obviously stated. My sentence, """"You seem to think that this is some sort of """"battle of the dialects"""" (lol), and seem to think that this is what I seem to think (now, that's redundant!) as well, but as I've CLEARLY stated, this is not so"""", makes perfect sense and only an idiot would not understand it. I wrote it redundantly to prove a point, not because I lack verbal skills. The point being, that you are an idiot and you can't understand the symbolic (or even literal) nature of my posts, and you interpret it into something that somehow benefits you and your cozy little world view. Ok, this will be the 100TH time I've had to clear something up for you, but let me tell you what this sentence means:

You seem to think this is a """"battle of the dialects"""". At the same time, you assume I am thinking the same thing. However, I DO NOT think of this as a """"battle of the dialects"""" at all, I think of it as a LOGICAL consensus that needs to replace the current one.

If you discerned something other than this, than you are retarded, hands down. I can't understand why you make all these radical interpretations, especially when most of my words are plainly visible. I am in NO WAY contradicting myself here, and if you can't understand this, then I am in NO WAY going to argue with the mentally retarded, for the guilt would prevent me from having peace of mind for quite some time.

About the Standard English, obviously, this article was written by a British person, and is extremely POV, thus is not a valid argument against this issue. That's like basing all your knowledge about drugs on government and anti-drug propaganda. 

Please man, let's put some sense into this argument, and remove all the non-sensical bullcrap you've included into. And don't ever, EVEr fucking tell me to go away, got it? People who back out of arguments are always wrong. They do that because they have no more to say on their behalf, and are afraid to """"join"""" the opposing persuasion.""",1

You are weary, stale, flat and unprofitable. You are grimy, squalid, nasty and profane. You are foul and disgusting. You’re a fool, an ignoramus. Monkeys look down on you. Even sheep won’t have sex with you. You are unreservedly pathetic, starved for attention, and lost in a land that reality forgot.
And what meaning do you expect your delusional self-important statements of unknowing, inexperienced opinion to have with us?

fobbing beef-witted clapper-clawed flirt-gill.

 Hi, Pompous Ass!  ;) 

I know you think you're some kind of poker authority on Wikipedia, and that it's somehow your perogative to give the Imperial final thumbs up or thumbs down on what's acceptable regarding anything to do with poker here, but guess what? That's not the case. You are one of MANY arrogant, conceited, self-absorbed losers that populate Wikipedia who use this site as some sort of self-esteem builder, because here you can act like a """"big man"""", and make unilateral decisions on what's acceptable or unacceptable here.

The edits I have made (and will continue to make) on the Jack Straus entry regarding his death doesn't violate policy in ANY way. If I had the time or the inclination, I could spend several months quoting entries and instances on Wikipedia where editorial verbiage is used. You are simply a pompous ass who thinks you are the gatekeeper of anything poker-related on Wikipedia. You are not, and you will not censor me. And as I'm sure you've already realized, my ISP address constantly changes, so you won’t be able to block me, either.

Dear bishonen, here you are again, weren't you forbidden to pollute this talk page anymore by your corupted interventions and arbitrary deleeting and bans?

Your actions, as they have always been, are completely discussfull and under all criticisms.
You are nothing but a little stupid idiot coming and called by ybm as he was ban and not by you! of course, for going again against the 3RR rule, and for having insulted enormously people.
You know of course that people following ybm are called by him and his Voyer """"Idiots""""? or did you forgot? so pay a visit to his website and get a free trip to wake-up land.

All my interventions were absolutly relevant and I am the alone person on this talk page acting like a real admi would!
I came as you certainly didnt read it, with a proposition who was suppose to bring an end to all this mess, but ybm and rjb and your friend snowboard and Maru just made it worse.
I have responded to attacks,and certainly not in the same distorded way who is so familiar to them and to you to express themselves, and your removal of my post is a censorship, a compleete censor of my words who are the truth but who disturb you,
You are the valey of ybm and nothing else and seems to enjoy it.
YBM has called Igor Bogdanov a Bastard twice a short time before you blocked me, you have no rights to do so and your excuse about having warn me a lot before is working a little thin don't you think? i do not have been warned ever ever ever ever by you.
Post warning is no warning.
You should be kicked out from wiki as you are absolutely unable to work as an admi.
This latest action of yours is so discustfull and after you and your boyfreind Geogre alredy did against me this is a Hetz and compleete harassement that you perform only because you know Nicky turnbull to be away for a wild.
You are so disraspectfull of the minimum of ethic and morality, and the minimum of truth and honnesty that I have no business talking with a """"person"""" with such a low standard.

Your accusations are false and malicious. You hurl accusations to justify your attempt to enhance POV editing in the article. There has indeed been bullying on the article but it has been directed AT me, not by me. You are obviously looking at this is a very biased manner. You punish Wikid for making a joke about a swine that offended The Magnificent Clean-Keeper. Yet, you punish me when I complain about horrible words being directed at me, including the repeated use of the """"F"""" word by The Magnificent Clean-Keeper towards me. There has been a great deal of harassment directed towards me, yet you totally ignore it or never looked into it. Then you make the totally false charge that I  misused mediation. That is outrageous. The mediator turned out to have a srong bias. He could not fulfill the role of an impartial mediator, in my opinion. To say that rejecting a mediator who had openly expressed a strong bias is wrongful is just more bias on your part. I agree that Wikipedia is not an advocacy site, and that is the exact point I have tried to make. BOTH sides of the murder mystery need to be included but since you have blocked both editors on the same side and encouraged the others to remove ALL of our work, it will hardly be a surprise when this article reads like the prosecutor's brief.

 WIKIPEDIA IS COMMUNISM!!!! 

It had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since graduation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.

Having returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.

As I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.

The conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.

It felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.

The intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.

No words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.

I awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as she slept. The feel of her pajama-covered breasts against me was a welcome sensation, as it h",1

THIS IS MY REPLY TO YOU THAT YOU HAVE DELETED ACTING AS A FASCIST FROM THE DISCUSSION ON NICOSIA PAGE:

Nicosia and discrimination against Greek contributors and the Greek character of the cityDear Salvio,

You have accused me of abusive behaviour against other users and consequently blocked me from editing the article on Nicosia for a 24 hour period.

May I draw to your attention that it is fairly obvious that those three users namely Seb az86556 , Seric2 and Chesdovi are clearly constantly creating a picture of Nicosia as a decadent muslim city that serves their religious beliefs and are all clearly hailing form Turkish backgrounds.

There is a constant undermining of the city´s Greek identity i.e. whenever a Greek flag appears in any single picture the aforementioned users delete that picture instantaneously and prefer to throw in pictures of the flag of """"shame"""" and occupation that is equivalent to a legalisation of a human crime of continuous brutal occupation of the island of Cyprus by the Turkish army.

The Greek flag is OMNIPRESENT in the Republic of Cyprus whether some people like it or detest it but this is the reality and an Encyclopedia that wishes to be UNBIASED should depict the REALITY and not the subjective views of a minority of readers that are furthermore based on extremist religious and nationalistic views. On the other hand, such users do find it appropriate to throw in pictures using the Turkish and the ILLEGAL, yes illegal according to United Nation referendums flat of the non-recognised internationally illegal self-proclaimed state of the so-called TRNC.

It is totally UNACCEPTABLE to have extremist nationalistic individuals, that strategically reached the level of administrators, deteriorating all the time the article on the city of Nicosia, promoting an unrealistic Turkish character and undermining the Greek character of the city AND at the same time having an ADDITIONAL article on """"North Nicosia"""" that is depicting a totally FALSE picture w.r.t the city. The TRNC is illegal, not recognised by any state other than Turkey and some terrorist states that are non-democratic and yet Wikipedia has a page on Northern Nicosia by supposedly administrators that support the unification of Cyprus. This is clearly a major distortion of their intentions and a huge lie in that an individual that pretends to be a neutral aribtrator and a supoporter of reunification cannot have a separate page on Northern Nicosia stressing how Turkish it is and then go and literally destroy everything in the proper page for Nicosia and emphasize the Turkish character of the city, talk about the tension and the division of the city all the time and undermine the Greek character.

This is clear nationalistic and racial discrimination against the indisputable Greek character of the area controlled by the Republic of Cyprus and furthermore it is downgrading for the Republic of Cyprus the mere fact that Wikipedia has a site that is CONSTANTLY vandalised by several ethnic Turkish extremists and Wikipedia users support such discriminatory behaviour.

In the light of all of this, I shall stop contributing to Wikipedia as I consider it downgrading for my own self. Furthermore, I do not wish to participate in an """"encyclopedic"""" project that is totally biased and discriminatory.

I hope that's not the case here.  Go ahead and call that what I just described a conspiracy. I dare you- in fact I double-dog-dare you! It is declassified and admitted and on a participating government website. I'll assume good faith, perhaps it is ignorance of the subject on your parts. It ok, I'm ignorant of a lot of wikipedia editing stuff. Belief in documented past history is the not the same as a belief in some conspiracy theory crap. Based on you comments about me, this is a concept you appear to be having trouble with. Any competent person would understand they are not the same. Is there was one available to you to explain it? I was explained to you repeatedly on this page and on my talk page. You are pretty dense of you don't have it yet.  You will find that my primary sources are 100 times more accurate than anything you'll ever find on about this fringe topic.  I am a subject matter expert on certain aspects of CBW and exposures but not on chem trails but no about to out myself to convince you.  Government declassified primary sources on WP are to be used sparingly. People like you make it difficult to talk about serious subjects. Reasonable people should not be constrained in their edits by pure ignorance unless ignorance is the consensus (TBD).  You are unable to consider ever it which speaks to your credibility. I've never seen anything like it except with the Japanese.  They never learned any thing negative about their national history in school and rarely consider that conflicting with their established beliefs.

Tell me or tell all of us about how its not true.  Next as a recently uncovered case Associated Press. Planes covertly dropping chemicals on kids?  Want the whole report?  See the Lawsuits over it? That should get you and people like you somewhere near the truth someday but my guess is for people like you it never will...  Bad sources that don't back my viewpoint? Hardly.

It appears, Ron, that you are frustratingly reading my paragraph above as if that is what I want to put in the article, when what I want to put in the article is posted on my talk page in one place so that it can be seen without continually being pushed up by discussion. My comment above is only *explanation*.

Sigh. Here again is what I want to put in the article. It's on my talk page. Sigh:

""""1. Not to be confused with shoto meaning """"short sword""""; confusion about the derivation of """"Shotokan"""" may occur otherwise. The Kanji for shoto, """"pine waves"""", is (松涛). The first character is (松), which means pine tree. The second character (涛) is a kanji variant of (濤), which means large wave. The Kanji for shoto, short sword, is (小刀). The first character is (小), meaning small, and the second character is (刀), meaning blade. Any literate Japanese reader who saw """"松涛"""" would not mistake it.""""

You say that you do not *agree* with this, but you cannot seem to explain what is *wrong* with it. It would make no claim whatsoever, when posted in the article, to any reasonable person, that the """"short sword"""" story is being told out there (even though it is; I just don't have it in a book for you, so I'm not trying to claim it on Wikipedia). It can be looked at as *preemptively* preventing confusion.

For someone who says he wants to work together, you are laying down a lot of conditions. I think it is reasonable to say at least:

""""1. Not to be confused with shoto meaning """"short sword"""". The Kanji for shoto, """"pine waves"""", is (松涛). The first character is (松), which means pine tree. The second character (涛) is a kanji variant of (濤), which means large wave. The Kanji for shoto, short sword, is (小刀). The first character is (小), meaning small, and the second character is (刀), meaning blade. Any literate Japanese reader who saw """"松涛"""" would not mistake it.""""

I think it's reasonable of me to dispute not showing the Kanji and it's reasonable of me to dispute not having that first sentence that basically says """"Note that this use of shotodoes not mean """"short sword""""."""" If you want to put in that sentence rather than """"Not to be confused with..."""" that would be fine with me.  08:32""",0

 I need some help 

Hello, I see you are a custodian, saw your message on the fair use issue. I am in the middle of negotiating with a photographer for a free license on an image posted previously as a fair use item. He wants it to be in Wikipedia but there is a language barrier and he needs help understanding what his choices are. I am worried am going to explain it poorly to him. He is from Switzerland and asked me to keep it simple and short how I explain it, not send him a link to a legal manual. Can you help me? I am conversing with him via email. I do not want to post his email address publicly here unless I get his approval. If you want to talk to me in email about this, my email address works in my box here. It is about an image Chowbok tagged and an additional one as well so I don't want to delay explaining the licenses to this person. I don't want him to be confused. He is a professional. I want him to understand well enough that he even opts not to license it if it is not best for him. We could try to get something else if it is not the right thing for him. But I think he would like to do this if we can just help him understand. What protects his photo credit best? GFDL? CC BY SA? Also, the GFDL mentions in the text that someone copying 100 copies or more must be given the source code, which is meaning a software package. For a photo, I hope the """"source code"""" would not be any greater image than what he gives us to put in Wikipedia. He may even decide to give us a bigger image than what we have up currently.

"Article has been merged and redirected

Content of this article was more in line with Photoshop contest than any encyclopedic article on Photoshopping in it's full or even slang use, so the text from this article was merged there. It may not read smoothly there, and may have more photos than necessary, but I put a cleanup tag there and certainly the minority of people who wanted this page to be able such contests can go there and clean it up to their liking.

I redirected this term to photo manipulation article, as it was more in line with what the term meant (though technically Adobe Photoshop would have made more sense, but we have to go with consensus I guess). It appears someone else just moved photo manipulation elsewhere, so that may have to get cleaned up later. 

But, bottomline here is that the Photoshopping article no longer exists, as it was clear from discussion that it never should have in the first place but that a few editors with misplaced motives ignored for a long time and edit warred across several articles over. Kind of sucks that even an admin or two was involved, but then I guess even admins can make mistakes and work in bad faith.",0

"""I had nearly moved on when I felt completely compelled to comment on this statement """"probably better than most clan websites, which tend to be based on long outdated stuff from the 19th century. Then I do not see a problem in using it until a better source can be found. Especially to make amends to the masses of unsourced information that is found on so many of the individual clan articles"""". I can only interpet this as something is probably better because it is newer?? This makes no sense to me. History is what it is, it should not change for the sake of change. If it was accurate over 600 years ago, it is just as accurate today. Again, if something is true and accurate hundreds or even thousands of years ago, it is not and should not be subject to change because someone decides to re-write it for either personal gain or an agenda. That is exactly what has happened with the origins for many Highland Clans. For any that might be interested, William Skene's and John Murray's collaboration of The Highlanders of Scotland: Their Origin, History and Antiquities is a wonderful and refreshing read. This is more than likely the truest accounting for several of the Highland Clans. It asserts that many of the origin claims put forth in more recent times are attempts to gain a foothold on the Chieftainship, by usurping the rightful lines. You'll find that cadet septs used this technique to basically try to re-write history for their own selfish gain. You'd have to read the book to see how this played out but as I said before, nearly ALL of the Highland Clans being """"bastardized"""" as Norman/Anglo-Horman/Flemish, etc. are really Dalriadan and Pictish mixes. Examples would be Campbell, Cameron, Grant, Davidson, Wallace, etc. I of course have distant YDNA connections to ALL of these surnames, but I know no one wants to hear about that as any sort of evidence. I'll admit not one of these surnames or clans has a pure lineage, but they all have a lineage going back to the Picts and Gaels. I am of that lineage, which is quite rare and continues to be established. The masses are not of that lineage, they are a mix if R1A1, other R1B haplotypes, the I haplotypes, etc. I will be the first to admit there may be hundreds of families, not even related through a shared male ancestor, sharing a surname or Clan. My concern is with the origins only, and the original Chiefly lines. And please don't tell me how we are a mix of so much dna, I am only referring to YDNA, the male lines. I am not talking about MTDNA nor Autosomal. What I don't understand is why when there is so much sourced information out there, some editors choose only to use factually inaccurate """"sourced"""" information. There is substantial """"factually accurate"""" sourced information out there however it is not my intent, to correct these erroneous articles or to present an """"opposing view"""". There is no opposing view, there is either the truth, or their are lies. Either the Celtic version is correct, or the Comyn version is correct, or neither is correct. There can't factually be multiple versions of an origin, it is what it is and there is only one true origin. This is not a contest to see who can provide more recent sources. I would hope wikipedia would want the truth out there, and not contests of who can out edit who, which is what wikipedia appears to be. There, my case is presented to the message and not a specific messenger. Clan Davidson is Celtic, it descended from Celts and it has no connection to the Comyn family. It did not descend from a Comyn male. They came from a very ancient Gaelic ancestor, an ancestor shared by several Highland Clans, before surnames even were in use. One other greatly incorrect update to this site was the battle alleged between the Davidson's and the MacPherson's....this never happened. The battle was between the Clans fighting for the Chief of the Clan Chattan, the battle was fought between the Mackintoshs and the MacPhersons.The MacPhersons were the true chiefly line, but were """"out-documented"""" by the usurping Mackintosh. This is pretty much exactly what is happening here, on this very page. I hope someone else has more time and energy to properly update this page with the correct information and let's bury the lies and factually inaccurate information comprising most of this article. It was originally much more factually accurate, but over the course of time has been corrupted with sourced information that is not also factually accurate.

"The Zafarnāma /zəfərnɑːmɑː/ (Punjabi: ਜ਼ਫ਼ਰਨਾਮਾ, Persian: ظفرنامہ‎, Hindi: ज़फ़रनामा, lit. Epistle of Victory) was a victory letter sent by Guru Gobind Singh in 1705 to the Mughal Emperor of India, Aurangzeb after the BATTLE OF CHAMKAUR. The letter is written in Persian verse.

Guru Gobind Singh sent Bhai Daya Singh to Ahmednagar to give it to Aurangzeb.

In this letter, Guru Gobind Singh reminds Aurangzeb how he and his henchmen had broken their oaths sworn upon the Qur'an. He also states that in spite of his several sufferings, he had won a moral victory over the Emperor who had broken all his vows. Despite sending a huge army to capture or kill the Guru, the Mughal forces did not succeed in their mission.

In the 111 verses of this notice, Guru Gobind Singh rebukes Aurangzeb for his weaknesses as a human being and for excesses as a leader. Guru Ji also confirms his confidence and his unflinching faith in the Almighty even after suffering extreme personal loss of his Father, Mother, and all four of his sons to Aurangzeb's tyranny. Guru ji invited Aurangzeb to meet him in Kangar village near Bathinda (Punjab) and said no need to worry as Brar tribe will not harm him (Aurangzeb) as they are under his command. On the way, there will be no danger to your life, For, the whole tribe of Brars accepts my command. (59)

Of the 111 verses, the maximum numbers of 34 verses are to praise God; 32 deal with Aurangzeb’s invitation for the Guru to meet him and the Guru's refusal to meet the Emperor – instead the Guru asks Aurangzeb to visit him; 24 verses detail the events in the Battle of Chamkaur, which took place on 22 December 1704; 15 verses reprove Aurangzeb for breaking promise given by him and by his agents to the Guru; In verses 78 and 79, Guru Gobind Singh had also warned Aurangzeb about the resolve of the Khalsa not to rest till his evil empire is destroyed; 6 verses praise Aurangzeb.

Guru Gobind Singh wrote this letter from village Dina in Malwa region of the Punjab. Guru Gobind Singh spent few days at Dina and then moved to Dod, Kotkapura, Dhilwan Kalan, Jaitu, Muktsar, Lakhi Jangal, and Damdama Sahib. Guru Gobind Singh's last fight with Mughal Army happened at Khidrane Di Dhaab now called Sri Muktsar Sahib.",0

"(UTC)

Actually, most of the romance words in English come from Norman French, abit removed from French (especially modern French). Then there is another grouping of Latinate words which came in via the Grammar school boys (Grammar schools of the late medieval being schools which taught latin grammar, and which required students to speak grammar at all times), and the ecclesiastical coinages, from around the same period (late Tudor England onwards). The first lot, the Norman French, had a rather different historical journey from the second lot, the second lot being rather closer to Classical Latin (actually most are Church or Medieval latin, but the difference here is not so great). The Norman French borrowings have a little more fanciness than regular Germanic English because Norman French was the language of the English ruling class (and law etc) for about 300 years. Most the food words come through this path. The second group (borrowed in from about 1400 to 1700) are fancy not so much because they represent the ruling classes, but because they represent learning. Then there's a few other words which come in from other places, like Piano (from Italtian), and others which are similar because they actually come from a common germanic/italic root even a proto-Indo-European root.

I think that it would be worth noting the path of derivation (NF vs Lating vs other).

On a second related point, the Germanic in English comes from several dialects, from both the North Germanic group (Norse) and the West Germanic. Old English had a few differing dialects. Northern English dialects tend to have a little more Norse and a little less Anglo-saxon, than the south-east. There are Norse and Saxon cognates which both made it into English, skirt and shirt being the famous examples. So, again some more information regarding the exact derivation of the Germanic, unless someone wants to go the whole hog and put in the proto-Germanic reconstructions. But that probably cannot be done. 14:17, 15 July 2007",0

Got a message about an hour ago from Professor Obar of the Media and Telecommunication Policy project and I think it is viewed best in full:

I have noticed that this has happened with a number of the projects already, for example, in the broadband.gov article and the media cross-ownership article. We need the students to be doing this on their own, of course so they can learn how to do it, and also so that I can grade what they've done. How am I supposed to follow student submissions if the data is associated with online mentors? A BIG PROBLEM ALREADY... please help me with this. None of you responded to my post about this on the discussion page. This is about to get out of hand. Jaobar (talk) 

With that, of course, please only give instructions on how to move, don't do it for them.  Please only let them know what to do and let them do it themselves.  If they run into problems, provide further instructions.  Do not it for them.  This seems to be making a mess of Prof. Obar's grading system and I would like to avoid that.  Thanks. -  • Talk • Coor.

There are no 'alleged illegal activities' for Karl Rove because there is no charging document as in, """"Karl Rove is here charged with violating federal statute XX.22.XYZ.""""  Therefore, as I asserted way back in the summer, you cannot say, """"To date, no charges have been filed against Rove for his alleged illegal activities,"""" since there are no alleged illegal activities.  No one in the federal prosecutors office is claiming Karl Rove has done anything illegal.  They were just angry that he defied coming in to answer questions which is his legal right to do.  He wasn't being charged with anything, therefore he did not have to speak with anybody. Then the prosecutor told the judge she was looking into possible criminal activity.  That changes the rules and now she is allowed to compel anybody in the Bush administration to come to answer questions.  Which she did and Rove showed up on time and answered every question.  Therefore, removing the weasel phrase that includes, """"so far no criminal charges have been filed against his alleged illegal activities,"""" is correct.  You cannot say he has 'alleged illegal activities' unless he's been formally charged with a crime.  The investigation will die a quiet death because it was politically motivated to begin with and the prosecutor has figured out by now that she won't be getting a seven figure book deal or promoted to AG.

1. user:Gscshoyru and User:Dreadstar must both cease ALL wikipedia activity and disband their accounts, or at the very least negotiable, cease your administrator status. this condition MUST be met to stop the vandalism. if this conditon is not met, the vandalism will not cease (users, if you really cared for wikipedia as you both claim, surely it would be in wikipedia's interest to stop me from vandalising, so in order to stop me, you must stop your wikipedia activity and/or drop your admin status) any time in the perceivable future.

2. That in the article """"Ronald Mcdonald"""", Ronald is listed as a """"happy"""" clown

3. That any defaming or negative remarks regarding Pee Wee Herman or Paul Reubens are removed

4. That any new edits to either Ronald Mcdonald or Paul Reubens are approached with respect (i.e, no bad/negative comments, no defamation, nothing that can be perceived as hurting the reputation of Ronald Mcdonald or Pee Wee Herman

5. That ALL articles regarding Mcdonalds, fast-food, hamburgers, french fries, and good corporate practice carry the """"Mcdonald's arch""""

6. that further more, the """"Paul Reubens"""", """"Pee-Wee Herman"""", """"Tony Curtis"""", """"Maury Povich"""", and """"Construction"""" articles are protected and NEVER updated ever again

7. that the """"controversy"""" section from the article on Mcdonald's is removed

9. that any reference to a Mcdonalds product carry the word """"tasty"""" preceding it

What, what?? Ooh no, I don't do FA-class – reviewers are much too awkward to deal with at that level. A-class coupled with GA are my limit. And as far as this article goes, it doesn't need improving, it needs a 100% rewrite – it has become far too sloppy and contains so much trivial stuff that the prose is terrible to read in places, events are all over the place (i.e. not very well written, chronologically speaking) and it isn't very encyclopedic any more. No wonder it was delisted and no one wants to promote it, which is a shame given that this man was a true British hero. In contrast Napoleon's page is well written, has better focus, and is clearly of a higher standard. If I were to rewrite this, I'd literally spend months starting from scratch in sandbox and simply replace the lot when done. I don't think """"leadership"""" is required, too WP:OWNish.

Radnath Sikdar
Dear Mr.Hike,

Thanks for your notice/warning/intimidation! Since, I could sense an emotional outburst in your message, I thought it would be worth spending a few seconds calming you down )

Please be careful in your edits
Oh sure...Iam always careful. I do not send baseless assumptions as warning shots to anyone ) 

Regarding Radhanath Sikdar: I think you need to realize that Wikipedia is a collaborative work - we develop articles by consensus. 
Thanks for your enlightenment. Unfortunately someone already taught me this fact a long time ago when I first ventured into this wikipedia ) Thanks anyway.

Simply reverting edits is counter-productive and against the etiquette of the Wikipedia.
I think this is your POV! There is a 'revert to previous page' button. May be your highness should dismantle it.

Commonly, we iterate until we can find language and fact statements that are acceptable to everyone. Notice that this iteration isn't a """"reversion war"""" - people discuss and change and adapt the article until consensus is reached.
Another POV again ) By the way - could you please enlighten me about who your 'we' refers to in all the above sentences?

Please explain why you are insisting on """"now called"""" in the Sikdar article, or, for that matter, why you are insisting on the mention of the name """"Sagarmatha"""". There may be a legitimate NPOV reason for the inclusion of both - without explanation, I am assuming that it is motivated by Hindu nationalism.

I must appreciate your exceptional ability to assume things. Fortunately, I am not a religious fanatic. But, I do know that provocative sentences like this fuel hatred and anger in the hearts of those groups you mentioned. Again I may be wrong. You know all ) But, I do feel that there is no 'present day sun' or 'present day moon'. That was the only impetus behind my editing it. Besides I also thought that there is nothing wrong in representing a fact (name 'sagarmatha'). Again you know all. 

My assumption very well may be incorrect, but no explanation of your reversion has been given. Convince me.
I confirm that your assumption is not only untrue but is provocative and preposterous. Sometimes even highly intelligent people like you do mistakes )

Note that the original name of Presidency College (in Calcutta, founded in 1817) was """"Hindoo College"""". Not """"Hindu"""" (as in the religion). Please stop reverting. It seems to me that if you insist on using one of the original names of Mount Everest, for consistency you must also use the original name of the college. Convince me otherwise.
As far as I could remember, I have been taught that the right spelling is Hindu, in India. Could you please let me know the difference between Hindoo and Hindu? By the way, could your highness ) please let me know how you assumed that I am an Hindu? I again appreciate your astrological prowess! Astrology is many a times fake - just fyi your highness )

I do not know why messages like this from people who know everything, makes me a little sad sometimes. I am envious of the brilliant people like you who can assume a boat load of stuff with just a two-line edit! 

We can continue this discussion at Talk:Radhanath Sikdar: that way, many people can participate.

Thanks for your attention. - hike395 03:35, 6 Jul 2004 (UTC)""",0

 The GAME Christmas Tinner hoax 

There seems to be a hoax product on the GAME website, """"The GAME Christmas Tinner"""", that alleges to be a complete Christmas dinner in a can. There are even competitors, one with a """"Christmas dinner in a can"""" that supposedly self-heats. The GAME page is currently marked """"SOLD OUT"""" until 2014. There are no credible consumer reviews of this alleged product on the Web, or even evidence that anyone has successfully purchased one.

It is currently WP:Original Research that this is a hoax, but the graphics designer (Chris Godfrey) shows a clearly fake """"12 course meal"""" on his website.

This seems to be 'viral' marketing for GAME, but it could also be marketing for Chris Godfrey.  (talk) """,0

From Fraser:

This article possesses a number of quite significant errors:

First, concerning the so-called characteristics of the deep house sound, many deep house tracks have a 'thumpy' bass drum sound, thus making them practicable for a dancefloor; although there is a wide use of effects employed in the production of deep house music, the use of filters etc., is no more prevalent than in other sub-genres of house, for instance disco house (where filters are used ad nauseum) and dub house (where reverb and echo are pronounced). 

In contrast to the traits mentioned in the article that characterise the deep house sound, I would argue that the most defining characteristic of the music is its mood, being typically abstract and atmospheric, more concerned with taking the listener on a mental expedition that making a dancefloor move.

Lastly, the statement that """"deep house music is often synonymous with 'Lounge Music'"""" is quite simply untrue and should not be kept in this article. Deep house music, although often possessing loungey characteristics, for example, vibraphones, smooth rhodes keys etc., never has and never will be seen as equivalent to lounge music. I am really quite shocked that such misinformation was put on the site; the person who wrote the article, whilst possessing some knowledge of the music, is well wide of the mark in a number of his or her comments.

I am basing all my judgments on being a DJ and avid deep house record collector for 10 years.""",0

I usually read all of a discussion and think about it, before replying to any of it.

We have yet to have any sources that show that Brian Harvey is an expert, or what fields he is an expert in.  It's rare for an instructor at a University to be tenured, and also rare for senior faculty to let them make policy decisions alone, without tenured senior faculty's input and approval.  Instructors are usually hired to implement policy set by senior faculty, and kept on if they do the specified job well. This frees up faculty for other tasks and projects.  But this is mute - see the next point. (But if you feel you have to, in Brian Harvey's case, sources please to show otherwise.)   

Brian Harvey is not what Wikipedia refers to as an Independent Source (aka third party source).  He has used Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SCIP) at Berkeley and has been acknowledged by Abelson and Sussman in the Second Edition of SCIP. (He is not acknowledged in the First edition. (Took me a little while to find a hardcopy.)) So using him as a reference is a small step from using Hal Abelson, the subject of this biography. Wikipedia asks that non-Independent Sources be used with care and only when an Independent Source can not be found. 
 
The Boston Globe reference has the same issue in their feature, and should not be used as we have an Independent Source.   

Chris Haynes and Dan Friedman are acknowledged in the Second Edition of SCIP.  Mitch Wand is acknowledged in the First Edition of SCIP.  So their book has the non-Independent Source problem.   

Which leaves us one source that  found. I'm not going to try and find out if it's an Independent Source, i.e. who was in the group that decided on giving Abelson the award.   

Without a reference, this sentence with the word """"worldwide"""" in it fails WP:NPOV. It is also unclear what it means: how many CS departments?, what parts of the world?, etc. Even with a reference, the claim should be in a quote from that reference, not in plain text. Wikipedia prose is suppose to be written in a neutral tone, with non-neutral text clearly tied to a source. WP:NPOV also requires that available WP:SOURCES (if any) that balance out the article on this and other parts of the text be added. If you know of one on this point or others, please add it to this biography.   

A claim this wide could have other Independent Sources making it.  If any one wants to find and add them ...   

The laundry list of course materials is trivia that isn't needed in a biography, and is distracting to the reader.   

So ....   

Proposed consensus

I propose we change the sentence to this:

The Association for Computing Machinery notes this course """"was widely emulated and adopted by colleges around the world.""""

and add this as a new paragraph, perhaps in a new section Awards:In 2011, Abelson received the Karl V. Karlstrom Outstanding Educator Award.  The citation read """"For his contribution to computing education, through his innovative advances in curricula designed for students pursuing different kinds of computing expertise, and for his leadership in the movement for open educational resources.''

If this award was published in an ACM journal, it be better to use the  template.

The Karl V. Karlstrom Outstanding Educator Award has neither an article nor a template. It's in over a dozen articles so far. Create either if you feel it's meets WP:N.

Present Day Canada Government website incorrectly Titles BNA Act 1867

The Government of Canada (mainly Liberal since 1963) is very """"skilled"""" at practising the Sin Of Omission as shown in the linked text below,

British North America Act 1867

http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/const/c1867_e.html

This website incorrectly refers to this document as the Constitution Act 1867, which is a misnomer, and a shameful one, indeed.

http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/const/endnts_e.html#(2)

(2)  As enacted by the Constitution Act, 1982, which came into force on April 17, 1982. The section, as originally enacted, read as follows: 
1. This Act may be cited as The British North America Act, 1867. 
 

 

I disagree with your interpretation.  You're reading a footnote, which merely says that *originally* the 1867 act was to be cited as the British North America Act 1867.  But, under the law since 1982, it is now to be cited as the Constitution Act 1867.  All acts forming the constiution were retroactively renamed.  Judicial decisions, and subsequent legislation, use this new naming system.  This reflects the fact that these documents were not a part of a """"constitutition"""" when originally created, since Canada had no consitution until 1982.  Collectively, these acts were turned into a constitution, and hence renamed.   

What?
""""Canada"""" had no Constitution until 1982?

You are completely wrong as well as per retroactive re-naming, that is not what happened at all.  Please get your facts straight.

"""::::There is a profound confusion in what Jim is saying. Maybe because he has left the movement many many  years ago? I have studied this subject in-depth and spoke with current students, one of which was initiated in the Knowledge just last year. This is what my research shows me:
The tecniques are very simple and there is ample evidence that these are quite ancient and referred to in many practices, books and poems
There is no """"magic"""" or """"grace"""" or """"opening the third eye"""" involved. For the last 8 years the Knowledge has been imparted via a video presentation in which people come and watch an explanation of the techniques presented by the teacher Maharaji.
Four promise are asked before the video presentation is shown (these are made verbally and no legal document signed, students are trusted implicitly.) Give a fair chance to Knowledge, don't reveal the techniques to others and keep in touch with the teachings. 
The whole presentation last 2 1/2 hours.
As there is no group activities ot colective payer sessions or any other type of liturgy, students are free to use these techniques (one hour per day is recommended). There is no cohersion to do anything, beyond the very mild promise """"give a fair chance to the practice.""""

And no, Jim, my sources do not include ex-students. This is an article on Prem Rawat/Maharaji, not his critics.

@Hans Adler, truth and/or verifiability

Let's talk about truth and/or verifiability. You had corrected the name """"Stadtzeitung"""" we have in note #4 of this article into """"Stattzeitung"""", because only the latter was verifiable, you said. Then, by chance, somebody found out the link to the """"Stadtzeitung für Freiburg"""" and the erroneous correction could be reverted. Notice that if there had been no documentation of the """"Stadtzeitung für Freiburg"""" online, but only, say, in a press archive in Freiburg, or if nobody had made the effort to verify the verifiability, the error would not have been detected, and the """"truth"""" would now be, erroneously, """"Stattzeitung"""". A beautiful mistake, by the way, very evangelical, being of the same sort as those we can find in the manuscripts of the Gospel.   ;-)

But let us apply this to another case, take Anton van Hooff, who is in charge to turn King's evidence for """"pseudo-science"""", """"severe methodological flaws"""" and """"factual errors"""". Of course, he has written this, among several name-callings, so this is verifiable. But can we take it seriously? If we look closer we see that the first accusation of van Hooff towards Carotta was to not have taken into account the well known Tacitus-passage about Nero and the """"christians"""". But since Carotta had treated it in detail, van Hooff was exposed, because he had shown that he had attacked a book without having read it, so that he himself was convicted of the """"severe methodological flaws"""" and """"factual errors"""" he tried to impute to other people. The subsequent escalation with the accusation of """"pseudo-science"""" was only his embarrassing attempt to divert from the lack of professionality he had shown. This, too, can be verified. The question is then: Which verification is relevant?

Van Hooff is refered to as a """"Senior lecturer of Ancient History and Teacher Trainer for Classics at Nijmegen University, the Netherlands"""" in the link given in note #17. But we see that at the University of Sofia he is also called """"Professor Associate"""". Looking on the Internet we can verify that he is called a """"professor"""" on several websites. Looking closer we can also verify that he was never a professor, and is by now a teacher in a secondary school, as he himself stated in a newspaper article. So what have we truly verified? That he is a confidence trickster who let himself be called a professor without actually being one, in order to improve his authority as an alleged important scholar? If we look to the list of publications he is giving there, we see that he is speaking of """"numerous books and articles"""" but specifies only one title. Modesty or showing-off?

Van Hooff being a notorious polemicist, can his accusations be taken seriously? Nobody does it in The Netherlands (why is there no article about him in the Dutch WP? – The only Antoon van Hooff listed there is a zoo director, who was ashamed of the homonymy), but he is taken seriously here, in the English WP where most """"judges"""" do not even understand Dutch. Why? Because it is so stated in the German WP already? If we take a look at the history there, we can verify that somebody had first put the article in the category """"Pseudowissenschaft"""" (pseudo-science), but then, this being not allowed because libelous, they """"discovered"""" """"Van Hooff"""", taking him as """"proof"""", without examining his credibility, happy to have the possibility to maintain their libelous allegation in an appearance of legality: it is """"only"""" a quotation! ;-)

I have added a section on the law of Kamma. I prefer to call it Kamma (pali) instead of Karma ( sanskrit) as there is a negative meaning associated with Karma.

This is a very pernicious Hindu doctrine and has been advanced by Hindu priests to escape from the social responsibility of alleaviting a man's condition. As per this doctrine all the poverty stricken, destitute people in this world must have been criminals in their previous lives. This cannot be true

The Buddhist law of kamma differs from the Hindu theory of Karma in this aspect. The buddhist law of kamma states that all actions are irreversable. That one cannot get rid of ones sins by asking for forgiveness or taking a bath in the holy river. An act once performed will leave its effect permanently on the society. It is the law of kamma that explains the maintainance of moral order in the world. It has nothing to do with the fortunes or misfortunes of people due to their actions in the previous birth.",0

Although if you want to get into it in many books I've read indicate Hong Xiuquan did not claim to be God either. He believed that Jesus was the Son of God, but not God. He had an Arian view of Jesus and of his own role as """"Son of God."""" Although I added her it sounds possible that this MITA woman only believed she contained the Holy Spirit rather then """"was the Holy Spirit."""" Yet you don't object on those or ones that may even be more debatable. In least in the case of Jesus the idea he claimed to be God is the mainstream belief of his followers and the existent writing on him. """,0

 Bad news; looking into the article history, this isn't stable (failing GA criterion#5) given how there have been massive changes recently and content disputes. That alone is an automatic fail I'm afraid. Here's some other comments from a glance:

Having a really large number of pictures simply clutters the article
There are way too many lengthy quotes within the article; please paraphrase
Phrases like """"her glamorous lifestyle, beauty"""" and """"a savvy business woman"""" are not neutral
How her parents met (as well as the Howard Young bit) belongs in their own articles, not here
""""didn't allow her"""" should be """"did not allow her"""" per WP:CONTRACTIONS
The """"social circle"""" and """"gifted Taylor a pony when she was five years old"""" are superfluous
Time (magazine) shouldn't be fully capitalized
Please make sure every paragraph ends with at least one in-text citation
Her marriages should be in prose form rather than a numbered list
Friendship with Michael Jackson is trivial
Not sure if """"In 1971, Taylor became a grandmother at the age of 39"""" is necessary
The big quotes on her conversion to Judaism are simply overkill
For accolades, keep the focus on what she won; mere nominations that she lost aren't particularly noteworthy compared to actual wins
Having a """"filmography"""" section consisting solely of a link to Elizabeth Taylor filmography is ridiculously short and doesn't by itself inform readers of anything meaningful. Either list all of her films in this section or just include the link somewhere within the """"acting career"""" section.
The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography link is malformatted and contains a HARVref error.
Some dead links need to be fixed

 Dear Leslie fyans, hello, and welcome to Wikipedia! I hope to not seem unfriendly, but I'd like to bring to your attention the conflict of interest guideline which explains the potential incompatibility between the purpose of Wikipedia to produce a neutral, verifiable encyclopedia, and the purposes of an individual editor. Conflict of interest editing often involves contributing to Wikipedia in order to promote yourself, your friends or family, or the interests of other individuals, companies, or groups you are closely associated with. When an editor disregards the aims of Wikipedia to advance outside interests, they stand in a conflict. Please review this guideline, and you may wish to also review the notability guidelines as well. Thank you for your interest in Wikipedia, and I hope you'll find many helpful areas! Sincerely, Ariel♥Gold 
Hi Leslie, I'm placing this here for your review, as your submission to articles for creation was specifically about yourself. Also please see Wikipedia:Autobiography, along the same lines. Normally if you are notable enough, reliable, third-party sources will exist, and an article will have been written. If you are notable (again refer to the notability requirements), but the article does not exist, you may request it, but either way, you should not edit an article about yourself, as explained above, as it would be quite difficult to remain neutral, which is one of the core policies of Wikipedia. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Thanks! Ariel♥Gold """,0

Hi!  I'm leaving you this message because you are listed as a Wikipedian in Louisiana.  The Wikipedia Ambassador Program is currently looking for Campus Ambassadors to help with Wikipedia assignments at Louisiana State University, which will be participating in the Public Policy Initiative for the Spring 2011 semester.  The role of Campus Ambassadors will be to provide face-to-face training and support for students on Wikipedia-related skills (how to edit articles, how to add references, etc.). This includes doing in-class presentations, running workshops and labs, possibly holding office hours, and in general providing in-person mentorship for students.

Prior Wikipedia skills are not required for the role, as training will be provided for all Campus Ambassadors (although, of course, being an experienced editor is a plus).

If you live near Baton Rouge and you are interested in being a Wikipedia Campus Ambassador, or know someone else from the area who might be, please email me or leave a message on my talk page.",0

 Hi — Love to help out with DoubIndemn 

Yeah, it's a drag there isn't a line of people wanting to help out with this great picture. I don't understand it; a whole lot of lesser pictures have crowds all bumping each other, wanting to edit.

My first comment to my (brand-new) collaborator is that your intro rewrite struck me as being a tad too beefy. Wait a day or two, then look back and see if a little of the background of the actual case, (para 3) might not go better a little further down.

''KM'' is the ''motor constant'' (sometimes, ''motor size constant''), defined as:
:\frac{\tau}{\sqrt{P}}

where
* \scriptstyle \tau is the motor torque (SI units, N·m)
* \scriptstyle P is the resistive power loss (SI units, W)

The motor constant is winding independent (as long as the same conductive material used for wires); e.g., winding a motor with 6 turns with 2 parallel wires instead of 12 turns single wire will double the velocity constant, Kv, but KM remains unchanged.  KM can be used for selecting the size of a motor to use in an application.  Kv can be used for selecting the winding to use in the motor./

"Seriously, How?
I am frustrated by the oblique nature of WP procedures.  You seem to be authoring Administrator Review procedures, so perhaps you can help in two ways.

First, I was drawn here trying to seek review of an administratorPMDrive1061 who deleted one of my articles.  I'm not keen on the back room ways WP operates, but I've certainly edited enough articles.  An article should go through an AfD procedure and be discusseddirect deletion is only for a case that blatantly abuses a policy.  When I went to this guy's talk page to complain, I notice he has polite complaints
from a litany of other writers questioning similar, direct deletion of their articles.  In short, this guy is habitually abusing his power as an administrator.  The significance of my article is not the issue I wish to raise, but I think it will survive a notability challengeit was about a small multi-grade Christian school that educates high school grades.  From everything I've learned, a high school is notable.  Period.  Much more important, I wish to raise this administrator's Abuse of Power.  We need to rid WP of administrators who unilaterally think their opinion is so important that they can simple delete knowledge from the database without anybody else getting to discuss it.  Other editors might roll over, they might not know how out of line this is.  I'm not going to tolerate this because we have to protect WP and its valuable information from people like this.  How do we go about getting this guy out of the elite administrators pool?

Secondly, since you are deep on the inside, maybe you can address this.  WP procedures are just too oblique for the common user to understand.  This stuff is designed for geeks.  It is difficult to find, difficult to understand and is thusly self limiting to the deep insiders who those who spend the time to figure this crap out.  I wish to encourage you to think about simplification, from the procedures, to the search to find the procedures to the explanation of those procedures.  If you note the vote for Global Sysops.  Yes, something as simple as a vote, publicized on every page and we've barely got 1,000 people participating worldwide in WP procedures.  WP has made itself into an elite old-boys club.

This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. Lastly, please note that if the article does get deleted, you can contact one of these admins to request that a copy be emailed to you.    """,0
"First and foremost, Lynda Kiejko won a gold medal and a quota in the 10 m air pistol, and added her second gold in the 25 m pistol. Because she already earned a quota in the air pistol, the Olympic slot has been distributed to the runner-up Sandra Uptagrafft of the United States. Granted the athlete has not yet earned a quota for their country means that a quota must be distributed to a different athlete from any country, as long as the NOC has been entitled to a maximum of two shooters per event. In Kiejko's case, she is eligible to compete in the 25 m pistol, but her place must be confirmed by the NOC and ISSF, along with the quota she won in the 10 m pistol. 

 Second, I notice that you added Michel Dion of Canada. Cassio Rippel already won a quota in the 50 m rifle prone. Because Brazil has reserved a place in each of the nine events, and he competes for the host nation, this does not imply that the quota has been distributed to Dion. As per rules on the host country places, these will only be granted in any of the nine places entrusted to the host nation, if it did not obtain any place in that event during the qualification period. With Rippel's victory at the Pan American Games, the host country still keeps a quota in the 50 m rifle prone. If he is confirmed by NOC to compete for the Olympics as long as he obtains the MQS (minimum qualifying score), then the unused host country place will be reallocated to the NOC with the highest MQS that has not yet obtained a quota place or been granted a Tripartite Invitation for the Games.

I hope that you fully grasped the rules and regulations on the distribution of Olympic quota. In case you may have not clarified about this case, I share you the link. . Thank you!",0

"Thanks 

Hi David,

Thanks for taking the time to write such a thoughtful analyis at Talk:DepoProvera. (And for reminding me it's Guy Fawkes!)

I feel that I don't need to assure you that I will not be offended in any way if you restate your position from our earlier discussion re Pfizer/LaCroix/BMD in the current disputebut just in case, please be assured that I will not.  It might actually be helpful to have other people than Mastcell and I making the argumentsperhaps more input should be solicited elsewhere, as well, if not enough editors contribute in a week or two week's time.

I will be slow-to-respond/disengaged on the Depo talkpage, in hopes of keeping things cool, while still continuing to advance the discussion. There is no hurry and deadline, after all.:-)

I don't know if you've been following the discussion at Emergency Contraception, but MastCell's first post to Depo occurred less than 30 minutes after the conclusion of this exchange: . It seems unfair to accuse him of harassment or wikistalking, but it also seems to me that he arrived at Depo already quite upset/confrontational, etc.    Because there is even the possibility that there is a causal relationshipi.e., he is angry re EC page and following me to Depo, (and Dalkon Shield) to express animosity, I think it is better that the Depo discusssions involve plenty of input from other editors.

 Scarborough Nicknames 

While I don't really want to expand on this section, there are in fact some web references to Scompton:

You know you're from Scarborugh when...
Busta Rules

There is also a wikipedia page called Canadian slang which references Scompton as well as a couple of other nicknames not mentioned in the Scarborough article. I used Clusty search engine to find these references. Up to you whether you want to put this reference back. I don't care one way or the other.

Regards,  

You're absolutely correct.  Serves me right for editing before my first cup of coffee in the morning.  I found nothing relevant for Scompton, but when I redid the search later, I did get results thru a search for Scompton AND Scarborough. I ought not to have deleted the entry based on a Google search turning up nothing.Personally, I generally don't see any value in having a section for nicknames for the municipality.  But there is obviously precedent for having it (e.g. Toronto).  The problem I have with these sections is that they end up including obvious entries (like """"Hogtown"""" for Toronto), but then also up end up including nicknames that may be used in some circles but don't have particularly wide usage.  The particular problem here in the Scarborough article is that so many of the nicknames have such a negative connotation  perhaps that's just a reflection of public perception, but I do believe that it does, to a degree, give the reader the wrong impression of the place.  Frankly, I am just waiting for someone to add """"Scandahar"""" to the list. I'm not from Scarborough, so I will leave the list in the hands of folks who have a better sense of whether its inclusion is justified.

This is a subject that is still controversial, both as to the area of origin and the routes

different dialects spoken in the Philippines at the time of Portuguese and Spanish entry to
the Philippines in the early 15th century were all of the Austronesian Super Family. That

In the Philippines, the two best known hypotheses are those of Peter Bellwood and
mine (Solheim). While my hypothesis—which will be the main subject of this
presentation—started developing over 40 years ago, Bellwood’s is more recently
developed and has had much greater acceptance outside of the Philippines. Simply put,
he believes that ProtoAustronesian

"International Symposium on Dr Axel Munthe

The second  international symposium on Dr Axel Munthe’s  life and work   will be held  on Saturday 13th of September at Hildasholm, Leksand, Sweden. 

From the Royal College of Physicians in London, Professor Ian McDonald (adjunct Prof Dept. Neurology, Yale University also Prof. Emeritus of Clinical Neurology, University College London will be speaking on the relationship between Dr Axel Munthe and the famous Professor Charcot of the Salpetriere in Paris.

The eminent architect, writers and former curator of Villa San Michele, Levente Erdeos will be giving a talk on “The makings of Villa San Michele, some connections to contemporary art and thinking”

Other distinguished speakers include the Swedish author, Bengt Jangfeldt,Dr Peter Cottino from Capri, Mårten Lindståhl, Sweden, Dr.Katriona Munthe-Lindgren from London, and Prof.Alden Smith, Department of Classics, Baylor University Texas, USA.

When Munthe received his medical degree in Paris in 1880 at the age of 23, he was the youngest Doctor of Medicine in Europe. His thesis was on the subject of gynaecology and obstetrics. Munthe had, however, been deeply impressed by the influential Professor Charcot in the field of neurology, and therefore already at an early stage was greatly interested in general diseases.

In the same year he opened his first practice in Paris, which was frequented mostly by members of the large Scandinavian colony of artists. He lived intermittently in Italy where he helped the cholera-stricken population (1880 on the island of Ischia, 1883 in Naples).

In 1887 Axel Munthe left Paris and settled in Anacapri where he worked as general practitioner. In 1890 he opened a practice in Rome where he was consulted by foreign dignitaries resident in Rome, as well as by Italian patients. He was appointed physician to the royal Swedish household to care for Crown Princess Victoria, later queen, from 1892 until her death in 1930.

During the First World War Axel Munthe served as a physician in the British Red Cross at the front in France. He described his activities in the book, Red Cross & Iron Cross, which was published in London in 1916.

Axel Munthe became a legendary physician who always gave free medical treatment to the poor. For some time he maintained a hospice for elderly, destitute people in a castle outside Rome. He was an outstanding psychologist who was extremely restrictive in prescribing treatment by drugs. The preferred forms of treatment prescribed by Munthe included hypnosis and therapy through music.

The Story of San Michele entirely overshadows all other publications by Axel Munthe, although it includes much of what he had already written earlier. His very first publications covered a number of travel discourses which appeared in the Stockholm newspaper, Stockholms Dagblad, and which described his experiences of relief work during the cholera epidemic in Naples. These discourses came out in book form in Sweden in 1885, in England in 1887, and later in 1910 in Italy. Subsequently he wrote a number of other papers and short stories which were later collected and published: for example, Små Skizzer, published in Stockholm in 1888; Vagaries, London 1898; Memories and Vagaries, London 1908; Bref och Skizzer, Stockholm 1909; En gammal bok om manniskor och djur, Stockholm 1931; Vagabondaggio, Milan 1933; Ein altes Buch von Menschen und Tieren, Leipzig 1934, etc.

Hildasholm, the house that Axel Munthe built for his bride in 1910-1911, was designed by the architect Torben Grut (who would later create the Stockholm stadium). It lies amongst the trees on the edge of Lake Siljan in the heart of Dalarna.

 Surrounded by gardens and pine woods it looks over the peaceful
waters and comprises Swedish, English and Italian furniture and paintings
from the 17th, 18th and 19th century Europe. It is still used by the family
while also being opened as a museum for the public during the summer
months. 

The gardens were created by Axel’s wife Hilda on the promontories
and in the ravines surrounding the house where suddenly the well ordered
English garden breaks into the wild and romantic natural environment.

I disagree with the analysis of John Z. Remember, in 1967 Israel agreed to UN Resolution 242 while Arab states rejected it... I think it is futile to draw conclusions about the outcome of the war based on what different leaders of Egypt and Israel agreed to at different times, if only because these decisions have as much to do with domestic and global situations as with the bi-lateral and regional conflict itself. In case of Sadat's peace initiative, the Israeli postion was also largely determined by the style in which it was presented. But, again, I agree with you completely that one-word interpretations have no place in the infobox or lead, and arguably, in the article. Instead, arguments from different sources and on different aspects need to be all presented and contrasted. No conclusion is warranted.  
 That simply isn't true about SC 242, though it is a common misapprehension.  See our article (or more comprehensible, less battleground-like old versions). Egypt and Jordan immediately accepted SC 242, while Israel neither accepted nor rejected it. During 1968 it at first privately to the UN Secretary General, and later publicly, gradually accepted SC242. A clear Israeli public acceptance including the word """"withdrawal"""" was not made until August 1970 as part of the Israeli-Egyptian-Jordanian acceptance of the Rogers B plan; it was controversial enough to induce Begin to resign from the cabinet.  See Shlaim's Iron Wall, p. 260 & p. 296.  

Yet again; this complex issue needs to be properly explored within the article body. I think that certain strategic benefits were seen by Israel (along with some drawbacks, as noted - mostly prompting renewed negotiation). Israel successfully defended itself, and held off joint armies again - this has probably prevented additional military adventures against Israel.
Constantly """"grandstanding"""" in the infobox is a futile exercise, editors should use their energies more effectively by creating a comprehensive explanation.   

This User Talk Page message concerns me. First, it accuses me of POV-pushing when I was reverting POV-pushing by an editor who has been changing a number of conflict infoboxes to """"Israeli Victory"""". More importantly, it could be regarded as Canvassing, and also suggests a strategic calculation to identify and sway """"sidelines"""" editors to a particular side. Might I remind editors that Wikipedia is not a battleground. Respectfully,   

=In battlefield terms the war ended with a clear Israeli victory.
After the 3rd army became trapped, Egypt's situation was desperate.
Among all warring parties, Egypt was the only one that asked desperately for a truce.
Not Israel.
Not even Syria whose capital was shelled.
This was confirmed not only by Israeli and American sources but also by the Soviet ambassador in Cairo that time.

=In regarding to political achievements gained by Egypt as a direct result of the war, 
I am quite not sure there is a consensus about this.
Not any one in Egypt saw the Camp David accord positively.
Shazly claim that this was a humiliating deal that caused the expulsion of Egypt from the Arab league.
If it was up to him, or up to the assassins of Sadat, this accord was never to be signed.

=Some may claim that only as a result of the war Israel accepted an Egyptian offer that it refused to accept earlier.
This statement is also problematic.
The peace accord was signed 5 years after war ended.
There were many other events that took place during those 5 years which made Israel agree giving back the entire Sinai Peninsula.
For example:
Before the war Israel offered Egypt a partition of the Sinai Peninsula.
Egypt will get the western Sinai in condition for peace with Israel and Israel will have the eastern part, from the 1967 border to Sharm El Sheich.
More than a year after the war ended the U.S. secretary of state Henry Kissinger threatened Israel that the US will not deliver F-15 airplanes to Israel unless it would agree to withdraw unilaterally from the western Sinai Peninsula.
Thus the Sinai Interim Agreement of 1975 made Israel losing a fundamental play card in the negotiation with Egypt, but receiving the F-15 and more arms in the future.
The US also started to deliver arms to Egypt in 1976 and Israel had to accept counter balancing guar",0

Developing your user page - it is easy
Wikipedia is a megalopolis and like in any city, interactions are very important. I recommend that you develop your user page so that people who visit your page may know your interests and share in them. It could be a single line telling others of not only your name but what you like or a complex page with every single thing that interests you on it. This is a great way of building up work groups that facilitate the sharing of expert knowledge on articles, talks etc. Happy building!!!     talk 

Become a great editor through diligence
Being a member of  the welcoming committee on Wikipedia I encourage you to help Wikipedia in any way you can to 
increase human knowledge. If you have credible information about a topic with verifiable references please feel free to add to that topic. If there is no article on that topic, why not start it, with time others will add to it and it may even make the featured articles list. By doing this, I have been able to make over 9000 page edits in both new articles, article improvement etc. Furthermore, I encourage you to aim to be a member of the  autoconfirmed users 
[] group as this will greatly improve your Wikipedia 
experience. You can do this by making at least 10 credible edits on Wikipedia and remaining on Wikipedia for four (4) days. Check out this page for tips.    talk 

Adding media to  articles
Media files, be it images, drawings or sound files are an integral part of Wikipedia's articles. They apart from enriching articles, make them more credible too. You can add media files to both your new articles as well as once you are editing. To do so you can search for it on wikipedia:commons or you can either upload the image if you have it using this file uploader or [commons uploader]. Please be informed that you must provide accurate information about the file being uploaded since they are reviewed and if if is found that the license given to the file is false, it will promptly be deleted.     talk 

Spotting bad edits and vandalism
As you age on Wikipedia, one thing you will come across and probably address will the issue of bad edits or vandalism. There are several ways of 
spotting them:
by reviewing articles on your watchlist regularly and looking for bad edits
verifying new changes to pages and articles
If you happen to come across a bad edit you may:
ask an editor you trust to review the work for his/her inputs
you can rollback the change if you have credible information that the edit is indeed bad
request that the necessary change be made on the article's talk page.
Whatever you do, please be very careful about the changes you make, for a rule of thumb, discuss issues you are not sure of first before making changes.    talk """,0
"""Ok i just noticed someone added
In James 1:8 the Bible states that """"A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.""""
What does that even mean? not that it's wrong to be there. I'd just like an explanation. might as well use 6 and 7

James 1:6 But let him ask in faith, without any doubting, for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, driven by the wind and tossed.

James 1:7 For let that man not think that he will receive anything from the Lord.

James 1:8 He is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.

or the whole 10 lines

1 James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are in the Dispersion: Greetings. 2 Count it all joy, my brothers, when you fall into various temptations, 3 knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance. 4 Let endurance have its perfect work, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing. 5 But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach; and it will be given to him. 6 But let him ask in faith, without any doubting, for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, driven by the wind and tossed. 7 For let that man not think that he will receive anything from the Lord. 8 He is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways. 9 But let the brother in humble circumstances glory in his high position; 10 and the rich, in that he is made humble, because like the flower in the grass, he will pass away.

So.. it looks like double-minded in 1-8 is refering to faith and having no doubt in 1-6. But it doesn't say anything about knowing. Or is knowing without having doubt? Can you be without doubt and still say u don't know? that sounds possible """"i don't know but i don't doubt it""""

Is theism only refering to christianity? or does it not matter anyway if only christianity is right? i don't think that would be NPOV

By the way, isn't God supposed to be beyond our comprehension? and if so, how can u know what god is if it's god is beyond our comprehension? and agnosticism is probably used more to say about knowing if god exsists, but i guess knowing what is god is part of knowing ultimate reality. hmm..

 Explain the changes you're making in a brief form in the """"Edit Summary"""" box you see in the edit form, just above the """"Save Page"""" button, or in more detail on the Talk:Tony_Hendra page.

The approach you've taken so far (adding lots of information to the top of the article, then lots of blank space to force the original content way down the page) is problematic, because it represents an apparent effort to """"hide"""" some of the information on the page. Wikipedia doesn't normally work that way.

Assuming you actually are Tony Hendra, I can understand your concerns with some of the current material in the article. The best way to move the Tony Hendra article in the direction you appear to want to move it would be to discuss the problems you have with the article on the Talk:Tony_Hendra page. For myself, I'd be happy to use some of the information you've been adding to flesh out the non-controversial parts of the article (though I would probably want to de-hype it a little to satisfy the Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view policy).

The material on the controversy with Jessica Hendra is more problematic. That controversy exists, and a case could be made that for good or ill it has come to be a significant part of your public notability. To the extent that's true, removing it from the article would be contrary to the interests of Wikipedia's readers, who expect to find relevant biographical information in a biographical article.

You might very well see the matter differently, and if so, you have every right to express that point of view, and to work with other editors to try to improve the article. To the extent we can arrive at some sort of an editorial consensus, though, it will help that improvement process work more smoothly.

There's no need to compromise an article to placate cranks on the Talk page; respond to them on the Talk page.  
There are separate questions:
Why is it called the """"World Series""""? 
Is it justifiable to call it """"World Series""""? 
Is """"World Series"""" meant literally or just a label preserved for historic/traditional reasons?
Regarding the answers:
The answer would appear to be: 1880s hype + 120 years of tradition/inertia.  
The first bit should be in the history section. The reference says In 1884, the Providence Grays of the National League outplayed the New York Metropolitan Club of the American Association in a three game series for what was originally called """"The Championship of the United States."""" Several newspapers penned the Grays as """"World Champions"""" and the new title stuck. 
It would be nice to cite an 1884 newspaper saying something like """"The Grays are now the Champions of the United States; indeed one might well call them the Champions of the World."""" 
""""the new title stuck"""" is rather vague: did it stick instantly and unanimously? Looking at the contemporary match programs on baseball alamanac, 1911 is World's Championship Games, 1912 is World's Series, 1930 is for the Championship of the World, 1940 is World's Series, 1941 is World Series. It's worth distinguishing """"World Series"""" the series of matches from """"World Championship"""" the title at stake in the series.
The """"New York World"""" urban myth is widespread enough to be mentioned and debunked. 
 """"The title of this championship may seem odd to some readers"""" is not a justification for answering this question, since it relates to the previous question. The justification would be something like """"Some people have (jocularly or otherwise) questioned the appropriateness or accuracy of the name World Series""""  
I speculate that there should be some juicy examples of such questioning from U.S. journalists in the 1880s, or Latin Americans in the 1960s.  There is the quote attributed to John Cleese: """"When we [the UK] hold a World Championship for a particular sport, we invite teams from other countries to play, as well.""""  
There are various arguments pro and contra that might be made. But only those that have actually been made by noteworthy sources should be given. 
The relevant information seems to be present in the article.

Hello, My name is JohnHistory. I was recently blocked for my mentioning of major problems here because I did not assume """"Good Faith"""" when confronted with bad faith. I believe that the biggest problem with this article and thus the best way to improve it is to intensely follow the Jimbo guidelines to the T. I am going to post what I wrote on my talk page after being blocked during the controversy here. I could be more covert in my contempt for violations especially given my long but yet humble ranking amongst the Wiki Elite but abusing editors and monitors must be accountable or we will always suffer from their petty tyranny. This surely does not make me popular amongst them, yet I must assume """"good faith"""" in them so that they will not prejudice their views against me and comfort their own politics in the process.
I was accused of supporting things I never did. All I ask is that criticism be included on par with other presidents. That is all. I don't especially care about Rev Wright, etc but if it is historical record and part of historically long campaign then I will stick my neck out for it.
I have to say that the amount of bashing of media and talk that has nothing to do with improving the article is highly tolerated if it is left leaning but anything even center of that is treated with heavy hand and often banished and erased. that is what struck me about the discussion page - mind you I never made an edit on the actual article I was banned for merely talking on a talk page. it was the idea that these so called monitors are in fact just random non scholars at home abusing the tools of wikipedia to further their almost personal agenda in a group- think environment.
Thin skin is no excuse for being literally fascistic in your approach to the open to the public - controlled by a small group of ideologues - Wikipedia. These political minding ideologues are 80-100% dominated by left wing or leaning people and controlled through even the excessive use of blocking for discussion posts and factual additions. These (not just mine) are non threatening non- offensive language - just the idea of one stating that their is a problem with the editors and monitors is cause to be blocked and potentially banned for not """"assuming good faith"""" or """"positively contributing to the consensus"""". what if the consensus is wrong then? What if about if you have already assumed Good Faith long ago and are simply diagnosing the major illness of the article as you see it? The evidence is more then abundant that these monitors are violating their tools and are involved in subterfuge or at least strong bias as evidenced between comparing Obama with W Bush. Additionally, the Obama Administration through proxies, in my strong opinion, is at work in the Obama article. I say this mainly because it is inconceivable to me that given the current administrations use and celebration of all things internet and aggressive pursuit of media outlets and shaping the publics opinion (as is understandable) that someone out of the thousands of Obama connected likely people is not involved on the Barack Obama page. It is the most visited page on Wikipedia and is one of the top hits for people searching the internet for the name Barack Obama. However, that is secondary to the already abundant supply of ideologue editors and monitors who seem to fill the demographic of the wikipedia junior officer ranks who enough of is all that it really takes. The number of those is in the millions. That is Why Jimbo guidelines must be followed as an example of the integrity of wikipedia as a REAL encyclopedia that could stand out in a scholarly work. The language given the Rulers of Wikipedia gives them broad ability to block and ban anyone they disagree with. OFten the language is contradictory. For instance I was blocked for my comments on the TALK page and cited for """"Making a point instead of wanting to edit"""". How, exactly, do you make a TALK page based discussion about edits without making a point? Another monitor told me I had to assume good faith, yet no good faith was given to me in my quest to improve article. In addition, the """"TALK"""" page says no writing will be allowed that involves """"general discussion"""" however that can be loosely interpreted and it could for instance only be 5% of what you wrote and then be grounds by a prejudiced monitor to remove your entire sections containing many posts. Additionally, the last guideline about general talk is only applied to people making comments critical or pot",0

And I just wanted to mention that my mother also had a surgery in 1996 for her epilepsy and it lessened her seizures to only one a day (and at around the same time everyday). I think the surgery did wonders in improving her life. However she experienced a Sudden Unexplained Death in epilepsy in January of 1998...about two years after her surgery. I believe the surgery had nothing to do with her death (it was two years later how could it be?) and that seriously, the surgery she had really did wonders for her. She was able to enjoy spending more time with us kids and less time worrying about if she was going to have a seizure any second. My mother's case was not hereditary. She has a very odd case. They were never sure EXACTLY what caused her to have epilepsy literally her entire life (well she was about 8 or 9 months old at the time of her first ever seizure) but my grandparents believe it has to do with a head injury at the time of her birth. But once again, they were never sure.   03:49, 28 August 2009",0

 why do you hate the poor? 

I've been following your posts/articles/biases and I find a frighteningly strong Right wing bias.  What were you raised rich?  Do you come from old money?  Or do you just have it all, brains, looks, white skin, strong religious following, money, and a job at a nice multinational corporation.  Well let me give you a heads up.  I am wealthy and well off too, but there is no need to flaunt or even protect our own money.  In fact the life we have lived should be enough happiness for us.  We shouldn't be always asking for more more more.  We need to learn to find time and space to say """"that's enough for me, please help my fellow man"""".  Your strong attitude towards Conservatives and especially the Republicans tells me many things:
1)  You don't believe in second chances
my comment is how can you not believe in second chances when the previous president Bush was a lazy drunk for a 1/3 of his life.  How can you not give a child who has never had a supportive dad, a clean mom, or a stable neighborhood to grow up on a second chance?  How can you not give a 16 year old girl who accidently got pregnant a second chance to live a normal life, rather than have an unwanted child who will never get the same love and support if it were to be born to a responsible parent?
2)  You hate or have no apathy for the poor
my comment is how can you have the poor and absolutely abhor any programs that help them if you have never been there yourself.  What would a rich upper class fellow like you know what its like to be starving and homeless on the streets of NYC or Miami after you have served your country in 2 different wars?  What would you know about not being able to pay off your mortgage on time when your employer fires you because deep down he doesn't like the color of your skin?  What would you know about not getting coverage for your handicapped son because all healhcare companies deny him on the basis of a """"preexisting condition"""".  Man you have lived a relatively well of life.   Now make way and let other people have a good life too.  

People like you sicken me.  You right wing d-bags say """"look at the bible, look at the bible, look at the constitution"""".  But show me where it says that disable and handicapped children can't get coverage?  Show me where it says war veterans shouldn't receive checks for combat wound incurred because the Veterans Affairs department is underfunded and can't pay out claims immediately and has a waiting list for 6 months.  Show me where in the bible it said to take slaves out of the poor, black, and under privleged to feed the desires of the rich.  You talk about the bible so much, you forget the inherent meaning and underlying purpose for it. It was written to teach you """"how to live and what rules to follow"""" not how not to rules and what rules to break.  I sincerely hope there is a hell for you and all you rich, white republicans who have never helped anyone besides themselves in life will end up.

God bless your poor rotting soul.  You shouldn't be worrying about tax breaks you should be worrying about making it to heaven.

""""What most people fail to understand is that when a person's magnetism is a result of exploitation rather than service, of violence rather than peace, and of cold-heartedness rather than compassion, then that person's then the character of that person's soul will attract so much negative energy that it will self deteriote and rot from the inside out before that person experiences any of life true pleasures.""""

Unfortunatly, that code takes away the purpose of assigning columns a width... so that the cells in the columns below have the same width.  I know following your code I could just add
colspan=# width=#%
to each cell, but that would be cumbersome.

Basically, I'd like it to be like this:
 a b c
 d e f g h i k l m

And as you can see in the code:
{| border =1; width=""""100%""""
|-
| width=""""10%"""" | a
| width=""""30%"""" | b
| width=""""60%"""" | c

| k
| l
| m

g, h, i, k, l, m, don't need to be assigned any width or anything.... they just take on the width of the leading row: d, e, f.

 a b c d e f g h i k l m

 a b c d e f g h i k l m

Qumar:deletion
This… I don’t know where to start!
In no particular order:-
.a)I found this had been deleted when it turned up on my watchlist,, though I never saw the discussion there; presumably because it was on another page, and this deletion looks like an afterthought.
.b) “decision was to merge with The West Wing # Foreign …""""
Well, actually it wasn’t.
3 voted for merging Equatorial Kundu and Qumar in a new page Fictional Countries in the West Wing;
2 voted for merge and re-direct to WW#F (3 if you count yourself)
2 others had no preference.
In the event you didn’t even do that; a search for Qumar leads to the top of the WW page, making it necessary to scroll through to find it.
.c) I find it hard to believe this would be agreeable to anyone who is interested in, or has contributed to, the WW pages; does that describe anyone who spoke on this decision? 
.d)The reason for the proposal isn’t that clear; “not notable”? So where does that leave all the other pages about fictional characters, places, histories?
.e)“can be re-created if sources are found to establish out-of-universe notability”; what does that mean? If it’s referred to in a book, like a commentary on the West Wing (though you don’t know, and haven’t checked, if there is one)? (for the record, there are at least 5 in the British Library Catalogue, and at least one in our town library; shall I check? Would it make any difference?
.f)“theres nothing on the page that isn’t said elsewhere""""; Well, there was quite a big page before (from memory), now there’s just a paragraph, so something has gone. And if information is in several places, what does it matter? It makes sense to repeat things/items/details from various places onto a single page to make the information more accessible; even real encyclopaedias can do that, the more so a virtual one.
.g) ) The page wasn’t (again, from memory) badly written, or un-encyclopaedic, especially compared to some of the pages I’ve seen; is WP so big that we can afford to be tearing decent pages out? (it’s still not as big or as comprehensive as a decent-sized city library).

Unless you mean all """"people from XXX"""" categories....in the case of regional districts, which have only existed since 1867-1968 and also do not include Indian Reserves in their governance, and have extremely limited powers (sewer, zoning, some planning and disaster management), they're not relevant to historical figures or anything to do with Indian Reserves or people from them; some users, like User:Backspace, and I, got into something like edit wars over his/her labelling objects like mountains, lakes, etc with them, and similarly provincial parks are not managed or classified by them in any way (different branch of the governance system, namely Ministry of Environment); there's also, y'see, Forest Districts and Forest Regions, Land Districts (which are the legal subdivisions but without governmental relevance of any kind), Ministry of Environment Regions (for parks theoretically but BC Parks, has its own system within MoE), Health Regions (hospitals, etc), School Districts, """"Counties"""" (which are for the court system but largely irrelevant to daily life), Development Regions (which ARE relevant to daily life and provincially-kept statistics, though tey're formed from aglloomerations/boundaries of regional districts but separate from them administratively), and BC Tourism (http://www.hellobc.com) has its OWN system of regions.  The rationale provided by the regional district categories-defenders is that because it's the system that StatsCan uses to divvy up BC for the census, i.e. counting people, then it """"makes sense"""" to use them as geographic subdivisions for """"where people are from"""".  But it just doesn't make sense....the problem now is that there's all kinds of mirrored wiki-clones which ahve statments like """"XXX Mountain is a mountain in the such-and-so regional district"""", though the more relevant reference is """"in the such-and-so mountain range"""" or """"in the xxx Country/Valley"""" (in BC there's lots of historical region-references of the """"Nicola Country"""", """"Shuswap Country"""", """"Omineca Country"""" type, sometimes capitalized, though often not, and often just """"the Shuswap"""", """"the Okanagan"""", """"the Omineca"""" etc, and regional district names, and also electoral district names, are often """"built out of them"""", e.g. Columbia-Shuswap, Okanagan-Similkameen; but I've also seen translated categories/articles saying """"Fraser Valley"""" when meaning the Fraser Valley Regional District; the problem is that only half of the Fraser Valley is even IN the regional district of that name (the rest is in the Greater Vancouver one), and similarly the Cariboo Regional District doesn't include all of the Cariboo, and itself includes a region known as the Chilcotin.  I've created categories for most of those areas, and a parallel hierachy for same, but have been challenged about that because their precise boundaries can't be cited easily; even though they're what people actually use and historically pre-date even the province itself.......there's some subcategories using that format e.g. Category:People from the Similkameen (where """"the Similkameen"""" = """"the Similkameen Country"""" and also Category:Cariboo people, although that's largely intended for historical figures from that region's glory days during the Cariboo Gold Rush and since.  In the way British Columbians actually talk, """"so-and-so is from the Thompson-Nicola Regional District"""" would mean that that person WORKS for the Thompson-Nicola Regional District"""", most likely an official or bylaw enforcement person.  Myself, I'd like to ditch this particular group of categories entirely but have yet to garner consensus for that; the rationale is that some other long-ago Wikipedian created the hierarchy """"and so we should respect that"""", even though that person, to me, was utterly clueless and shouldn't have created them at all.  The only thing the main RD categories should be used for is the component municipalities; though there are some Electoral Areas that have articles; but ti's when those start getting used as geographic descriptors, it's entirely offbase; it's all over Googlemaps and Wikimaps, too, and it's really annoying to see; similarly the use of the French-form of Indian Reserve names has similarly been borrowed and pasted all over hell's half digital acreage because it's what StatsCan (wrongly) uses.

 From Loomis 

I guess I just missed your question. I rarely if ever ignore the challenge of an intelligent question. In fact, I'm sure you've noticed in my posts that I tend to repeat my philosophy over and over (perhaps too much!). I strongly believe in what's called the Socratic Method. By that I mean that I believe that the best way at arriving at (something at least close to) the truth is by asking questions, rather than stating opinions. 

Unless a question is completely insulting or moronic, I consider it a challenge to answer it. If I can't answer it properly, I force myself to rethink the matter.

Your question was a good one, and it may take a bit of research on my part because, while I do believe I have a good deal of knowledge on the subject, you've touched on a couple of details I wasn't completely familiar with. Maybe I was just being lazy by overlooking your question. Or maybe it was because I just felt the rest of you guys have had enough of my opinionated and controversial posts, that I thought I should just leave it alone, and give you guys a break.

In any case, I'll definitely give it some good thought and I promise to get back to you, ok! (Don't worry, don't feel like you're giving me """"extra work"""". I'm actually flattered that you'd be interested in my response! I'll be more than glad to develop an answer, especially knowing that someone is actually interested in it!)

I just have a few questions for you. I'm just curious about a few things. For one, I'm very curious about the name """"Evilbu"""". Does it mean something in Flemish? (Is the """"Flemish language"""" really any different from Dutch? I speak French and when I visited Belgium, their French was completely comprehensible, with the exception of a few odd words like """"septant"""" rather than """"soixant-dix"""" for """"seventy"""", etc). Also, you said something about you """"being too young"""". You don't have to answer any of these questions, I respect privacy. But if you don't mind, how old are you? Finally, you say you're """"not a Zionist"""". That can mean one of two different things. One is that you're simply not a Zionist the same way as I'm simply not a Belgian. I've got nothing against Belgians, I'm just not Belgian. Similarly, you could have just been saying that you're simply not a Zionist. You've got nothing against Zionism, you just simply aren't one. Of course it could also mean something very different. It could mean that you're against Zionism.

But that's ok too. I'm sure you know this, but the Jewish religion is a non-proselytizing religion. What that means is that we don't go around knocking on people's doors trying to convince them to become Jewish. In fact, we don't even find it necessary to explain or rationalize our faith to others. What we believe is what we believe, and what you believe is what you believe. No need to """"sell"""" our religion to anyone else.

The reason why I'm bringing this up is because unlike Judaism, Zionism, to a certain extent, has to be explained, clarified and rationalized to others. So what I'm saying is that while I won't even bother explaining Judaism (unless of course you're curious, and even then, it would be in a totally """"interfaith"""" manner, respecting whatever you are and not trying to change it,) I believe it's my duty as a Zionist and as a Jew to help you to understand why we, as Jews, believe so dearly, that it is so incredibly important that we have a homeland, a safe haven.

My numerous beefs with the template:
Poor coding
Clear:right; is preferable to unnecessary line breaks
a single text-align:center;"""" is preferable to repeating needlessly align=center for every cell
A width definition is preferable to margins, and more commona cross wikipedia.
there is absolutely no need to have the comment be inserted in every page as it is specifically intended only for the template page.

There is no apparent reason to have a category in the template. the category would be just as well put independantly.
The link in the header was misleading as implying an article limited to western Russia. Unless Kremlin actually is, but I doubt that, and can't really tell anyway.
No background color in the header, unlike 90% of wikipedia footers
Picture enlarging header unnecesssarily, at the very least it should be reduced and move in the content section of the footer.
80% is unnecearily small for a simple footer like this. Most wikipedia footers do very well with 90%

Taekkyeon is a sensitive topic because many people want to learn it and not enough qualified teachers to disperse the knowledge.

Taekkyeon was a military artform first and a civil cultural game for children and adults later. By calling Taekkyeon a civil martial art game is demoting it from its real status.

The Constitution also authorized Congress to borrow money, and Congress done that by authorizing the issuance of bills of credit known as United States currency notes.

Similarly, Federal Reserve Notes are issued by the twelve Federal Reserve Banks and those notes are, by statute, redeemable in United States dollars. 

Each Federal Reserve Note identifies the issuing bank by the first character in the note's serial number. For example, the letter """"A"""" represents the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. A complete list (A through L) can be found in Federal Reserve Bank. The Organization Cetificate of each Federal Reserve Bank is on file in the office of the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency. Each certificate lists the names of the private banks that own and control the Federal Reserve Bank named in the certificate.

"Sure! Both for you adapting it to the German Wikipedia and for me adding DM and Euro it. In fact, adding a new currency is pretty easy, although I think I'll change the structure so that individual currencies are stored in individual pages, for an easier maintenance.

But first tell me: do these numbers take into account the change in currency, so that values in DM get automatically converted to Euros if I simply go multiplying year after year? Or will an input in DM also output in DM?

"This article about same-sex marriage.  In the lede, the issue of same-sex marriage is said to be a human rights issue, an equality under the law issue, a political issue.  The article says marriages are legal and social institutions.  The article then goes on to explain why some favor changing the law to recognize same sex marriage, and it explains why some oppose changing the law to include same sex marriage.  
I don't see why a lawyer, a law professor, a politician, a judge, a law review article etc would not be considered an expert on the subject (if not they then who).  Also, the entire issue of being an expert was in regards to Self Published Sources only (Wikipedia states that a SPS may be used if the author is a recognized expert).  None of the citations are SPS  and if they were they are still experts.
As I have told you law review articles are easily accessible due to the wonder of the internet, and I highly suggest you follow you own advice and read the citations above (and yes to answer your question I have verified the articles).
I don't know if you're going to object to online news articles, but this is more for your own personal edification, Nat Gertler, to help you understand that argument of incest to polygamy is an argument that is being made.

 Super Bowl Loss 

The recent Super Bowl loss is a highly significant event in the history of the Patriots franchise. The opening section discusses the """"dynasty"""" status of the Patriots, but hardly mentions the effect of the recent loss. This page has featured status for fair and proper discussion of important Patriots facts. However, the page now feels unbalanced and biased due to its brief and perfunctory coverage of this highly significant loss. It is beginning to feel like a protected fan page, as opposed to a balanced and factual discussion of important facts relating to the Patriots. Obviously the page should be protected from vandalism by Giants fans, but this page needs to acknowledge that the Patriots lost a game that many football experts are calling one of the greatest upsets of all time.  137.159.153.35  DLOMME 02/06/08
Yup.  communicator/kills 

 Taunting Disguised as Factual Information 

Looking through the history of edits since the Super Bowl, a lot of information that's being added (and much of it since deleted) may be true, but the inclusion of it into the article seems more like a subtle attempt at taunting.  Is it really relevant that the Patriots are the first 18-1 team NOT to win the Super Bowl?    Who cares?  And believe me, I'm no Patriots fan (they've been a thorn in my team's side since last season's playoffs), but this is supposed to be an encyclopedia entry, not a fan forum.  This page should be locked from any further edits for awhile, unless something TRULY relevant to the Patriots should suddenly occur.   
Actually, protection is not something to be taken lightly.  Being an admin (and even though I am a die-hard Pats fan myself), the level of problematic edits to this article, while high, is not so bad that we haven't been able to keep up with it by rollbacks and undos.  .talk.contribs

 Protection  

This article is starting to get vandilized again. If it were up to me I would make it temporarly semiprotected. I wonder why vandilism is returning to it. Get over it people, the superbowl's over!!!  
So you want me to request semi-protection?  communicator/kills'' 

 Bias?? 

The Franchise history section seems to be a little biased against the Patriots.  Whenever a Superbowl loss is mentioned, the opposing team and score are given.  When it gets to the part about the Patriots winning Superbowls not only are the teams/scores not given, but it doesn't even say that they won them.  ie: """"Under Belichick, the team went to''' three Super Bowls in four years...""""  It should be consistant one way or the other.

The sentence, """"The Patriots, however, were defeated by the New York Giants in Super Bowl XLII, after winning the first 18 games of their 2007 season.""""  is very clumsily tacked on to the first section.  I think it warrants another sentence or 2 or at least the deletion of the word """"howev",0

OurMed
Hi! My name is Marilena Tsangaroulis and I'm on the Volunteer Committee of an online healthcare movement called """"OurMed"""".

At OurMed, we're committed to creating an interactive health site that uses a global, collaborative tool like with Wikipedia but goes an important step furtherwe verify all content by healthcare professionals like yourself.

We launched the Wikipedia version last year (OurMed's Site) , and this year we’re adding a host of important features that will make Ourmed an extensive site for unbiased and user driven clinical research/tools for physicians as well as user friendly resources for patients and consumers. You can have a peek at our new design here: (Our New Site in Development)

Although we have a section on editorials in the new site, the new one will emphasize non-commercial, unbiased informationall entirely free. The organization is governed by a non-profit Board made up of Healthcare professionals, the former head of Wikipedia, Florence Devouard, former accountant of Wikipedia Oleta McHenry and other professionals.

Here's a short video of our plans: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAqbMl1dVk

Please let me know if you'd like to learn morewe're quite excited but could use your assistance in nudging this project forward.

"Vegan rebuttal 

Hello,

I have been following this vegan debate and I have to point out a failure in your revision.

You seem to be writing from a mainstream American or Western point.

Most of the world does not shop at supermarkets - they shop in open markets - and specifically, the majority of vegan would go out of their way to support small independent grocery stores not chains.

With regards to All cuisines, again, this is an important issue.

You get your point for knowing Asian food but it is important from a vegan point of view to show that vegan diet is not something alien from another planet as one contributor wanted to add but something local and traditional to all nations and races.

One does not need to list all nations ; Asian, Mediterranean, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Scottish, Italian, African, South American etc but yet they all have specific vegan dishes and ingredients which most metropolitan vegan sample.

A modern vegan will tend to eat a far wider range of foods than a regular omnivore and the topic out reflect it.

What is the specific benefit to writing supermarket or excluding all of the above apart to your ego?

Likewise there are many other sources to buy such products - such as the internet - so it is utterly unnecessary.

Let it be.

If not in the gadhimai festival article then where should we give a chance to Hinduism as a religion of non-violence? The article attributes all the animal killings of the festival to Hinduism.

I can understand the concern, but let me tell you my experience about reading this marvelous article.  Moni, you really are courageous for taking this article on.  I stopped reading it as an editor, and couldn't stop.  It felt like I was reading a story, one that captivated me, and as is often the case when I'm reading a story with a lot of players in it, I did forget who everyone was.  However, I was okay with that because that's often my experience when dealing with a large cast of characters.  I forget the details, like who did what and when and to whom, but I either go back and fill in what I've missed or forgotten about, or I was go with the flow and trust that the players are important.  The latter is what happened as I read this article.So this is my long-winded way of saying that perhaps forgetting the cast is part and parcel of the fact that so many people are involved.  Everyone's story is important, and you had to pick and choose what to include here.  I don't think it's something you should concern yourself about, since I'm not sure there's much you could do to remedy the situation, anyway.  And I'm so sure that you should.  Hope this helps.",0

I see one of the references you're using is from Timber Press - I've adored that publisher for quite some time (and they have quite a bit of my money).

Basically, the multi-propose Approval Voting we recently used, is designed precisely for that. Approve an alternative means approval, no vote to an alternative means oppose. The result gives that or those alternatives which have highest net voter number, just as Irpen wishes with """"approve & oppose"""". The only basic structural weakness of Approval Voting (if voters are honest) actually is that it is not designed to register priority order of a voter and thus not whether an individual approve vote is strong or weak. But even this can be made by enlightened voters, they just need to write """"weak approve"""" or """"strong approve"""" when voting for any alternative - and the interpretation will be the task of the interpreter. However, what happened with the (yet ongoing) vote is not due to weaknesses of the voting system, but due to the problem that our subject is difficult to name in a generally accepted way. She simply is difficult. There are reasonable, sufficiently-well-founded arguments her to be placed under headings which almost all make some to oppose. And thus the vote splits. This being the basic situation, NO VOTING SYSTEM will ever cure it - unless using """"violence"""". Of course a voting system could be designed which favors something and violates some others, and thus a decision will be made - against half of the population who are then totally pissed at. Such voting systems were used by dictators, by oligarchs, etc.
Personally, I am somewhat puzzled why not a higher number of people came and put their (perhaps secondary, or label """"weak"""") approval to """"Alexandra of Hesse"""" - but that is the result of the will of those voters.  """,0

 Swastika as a mnemonic device http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html 

The article needs more information about the swastika's use as a modern mnemonic device. Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, Professor Rex Curry discovered that it was also used sometimes by the National Socialist German workers Party as alphabetic symbolism, including meshed """"S"""" letters for their """"socialism."""" The leader of German National Socialists at that time altered his own signature to use the same stylized """"S"""" letter for """"socialist"""" and similar alphabetic symbolism still shows on Volkswagens.  Professor Curry showed that many modern myths use a false belief that Nazis called themselves """"Nazis.""""  The myths cause widespread ignorance of the eytmology of the word """"Nazi."""" Party members called themselves """"National Socialists,"""" not """"Nazis.""""  Dr. Curry showed that many modern myths about swastikas use the false belief that Nazis called their symbol a """"swastika.""""  German National Socialists did not call their symbol a """"swastika.""""  Another person conceded the point with the comment that """"It does seem to be the case that the National Socialist German Workers' Party originated the 45° orientation...."""" though they did not necessarily originate that use, the German National Socialists did independently alter their use of the symbol for their specific desire to highlight the """"S"""" letter for """"socialism."""" Of course, the additional comment that they didn't use the 45 degree orientation consistently also concedes Professor Curry's work showing that their leader deliberately altered / evolved the symbol from its historic orientation into meshed """"S"""" letters for socialism. The graphic resonance is highly suggestive... and in fact it is compelling! In fact, one of the flags that Dr. Curry cites argues for that thesis: The swastika itself comprises two S's, and that is shown to have been known consciously when the German National Socialists overlay two additional S's for another group (as German National Socialists had other examples of similar alphabetic symbolism). Hitler even altered his own signature to reflect the same """"S"""" for socialism and similar alphabetic symbolism still shows on Volkswagens. http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html The leader of the German Socialists had no reason to harp on this idea because he was an ex-artist. Nevertheless, he did allude to the alphabetic symbolism in his own comments in his notorious book. Of course, he would not drone on about it just as he did not drone on about what the stylized """"SA"""" symbol meant, or the side-by-side """"SS"""" symbol, or the """"VW"""" (all of which other writers concede for some inconsistent reason). The only reason it is so hard for most people to understand today is because they have been trained to use the hackneyed shorthand for the Party and most people are ignorant of the name of the actual Party, and thus have no idea that the Party actually espoused a dogma that they called """"Socialism."""" Even to this day, people repeatedly delete Dr. Curry's work in an effort to perpetuate the ignorance and the myths.""",0

Ferdinand Emmanuel Edralin Marcos (September 11, 1917 – September 28, 1989) was 10th President of the Philippines from 1965 to 1986. He was a lawyer, member of the Philippine House of Representatives (1949–1959) and a member of the Philippine Senate (1959–1965). He was Senate President in 1963. He claimed to have led a guerrilla force called Ang Maharlika in northern Luzon during the Second World War, something much doubted however to be true.[1][2] As Philippine president and strongman, his greatest achievement was in the fields of infrastructure development and international diplomacy. However, his administration was marred by massive authoritarian corruption, despotism, nepotism, political repression, and human rights violations. He benefited from a large personality cult in the Philippines during his regime.[3] In 1983, his government was implicated in the assassination of his primary political opponent, Benigno Aquino, Jr.. The implication caused a chain of events, including a tainted presidential election that served as the catalyst for the People Power Revolution in February 1986 that led to his removal from power and eventual exile in Hawaii. It was later alleged that he and his wife Imelda Marcos had moved billions of dollars of embezzled public funds to the United States, Switzerland, and other countries, as well as into alleged corporations during his 20 years in power.

Ferdinand Emmanuel Edralin Marcos was born September 11, 1917, in Sarrat, Ilocos Norte outside Laoag City to parents Mariano Marcos and Josefa Edralin. He was named after Ferdinand VII of Spain and baptized into the Philippine Independent Church. According to the Marcos family's oral history, the family name was originally Taguktok, and their Ilokano roots have some Japanese and Chinese ancestry. Ferdinand was a champion debater at the University of the Philippines, where he also participated in boxing, swimming and wrestling.

In December 1938, Mariano Marcos, his brother Pio, his son Ferdinand, and his brother-in-law Quirino Lizardo were prosecuted for the murder of Julio Nalundasan. On September 20, 1935, the day after Nalundasan (for the second time) defeated Mariano Marcos for the National Assembly seat for Ilocos Norte, Nalundasan was shot and killed in his house in Batac. According to two witnesses, the four had conspired to assassinate Nalundasan, with Ferdinand Marcos eventually doing the killing. In late January 1939, they were denied bail [4] and in the fall[when?] of 1939 they were convicted. Ferdinand and Lizardo received the death penalty for premeditated murder, while Mariano and Pio were found guilty only of contempt of court. The Marcos family took their appeal to the Supreme Court of the Philippines, which on October 22, 1940, overturned the lower court's decision and acquitted them of all charges but contempt.[5]

In 1939, while incarcerated, Ferdinand Marcos graduated cum laude with a law degree from the U.P. College of Law. If he had not been put in jail for twenty seven days, he would have graduated magna cum laude. He was elected to the Pi Gamma Mu international honor society. While in detention, Governor Roque B. Ablan Sr. of Ilocos Norte helped Marcos study for the bar exams by providing a desk lamp in his cell, law books and reviewers. Marcos passed the bar examination with an almost perfect score of 98.01%, while also writing an 830-page defense. Several people contested his score and a retake was taken albeit an oral bar examination witnessed by several people. His second bar examination resulted in a 100% score, the highest grade obtained in the Philippine Bar).[6]

Marcos became senator after serving as member of the House of Representatives for three terms. In the Senate he served as minority floor leader before gaining the Senate presidency. He established a record for having introduced a number of significant bills, many of which found their way into the republic's statute books.[7]
[edit] Personal life

He was married to Imelda Romualdez-Marcos, with four children: Maria Imelda """"Imee"""" Marcos, Ferdinand """"Bongbong"""" Marcos, Jr., Irene Marcos, and Aimee Marcos, who was adopted.

The cabinet appointments of President Marcos can be divided into three periods: his first two constitutional terms (1965–1973), the New Society appointments from 1973–1978, and the change from departments to ministries from 1978 to the end of his government.

 Are you being deliberately obtuse? 

I know this is a scientific subject, but it seems that the writer of the article is being deliberately obtuse.  I quote:

""""The ear for example, takes a spectral decomposition of sound as part of the process of turning sound into neural stimulus, so certain time domain effects are inaudible.""""

Now, I'm grappling with what that sentence means. I think I know what you are trying to convey, but your method of speech is stupefying.  I am not a scientist, by the way, just someone interested in the subject of sound, so when presented with a sentence like the one above, I think to myself: """"Is this guy taking the piss?""""  I used to write this badly at A-level when I wanted to impress the teacher I wanted to shag.  It looks nice, all very academic, but it conveys its meaning poorly.  

A tip from a writer: When conveying a difficult idea, be explicit - avoid pompous, vague or technical statements unless you have no choice.

If you really must couch an explanation in such technical jargon, add a second clarifying sentence for us mere mortals who do not understand the scientific jargon.  Start a second sentence with 'In other words,' and repeat what you are trying to convey in very simply, easy language.  Example:

""""In other words, some frequencies are lost when interpreting the physical sound we hear.""""

I'm not entirely sure if that was what you were trying to say, because your original sentence was so palpably obtuse.  But I'm sure you get the gist: if you absolutely, positively have to use technical language, ensure that you follow it up with a layman's explanation as best you can.  It doesn't matter if you can't convey what you mean absolutely accurately, because the layman can then go back and read your original technical sentence and try to piece together what you are saying given the context of the easier sentence.  

For God's sake, once in a while go back and read what you are writing.  This whole article is riddled with raving gibberish and obfuscation.  Absolutely unreadable!

"""

Wikipedia's founder, Jimmy Wales, has admitted that the much loved """"free encyclopedia"""" has at least some quality problems. To some of us, this is nothing new. I've had more than one student rely on Wikipedia for accurate information for a paper, and it always ends up the same way: """"well, I got it off of Wikipedia, thinking it was good..."""".

And therein lies the problem. If you keep in mind that anyone, and I mean anyone, can edit a Wikipedia entry, then you are treading on dangerous ground if you're going to cite it as a source of fact. While it's true that errors often get corrected, they don't always, and what happens in the meantime is that bad info sits there, misinforming people. Of course, this isn't true just in the case of Wikipedia. It's a problem online, in general. I recently was party to an argument over the historicity of Jesus, and one person used a source that claimed that Philo of Alexandria lived in Jerusalem. He's called Philo of Alexandria for a reason, you know.[] 

I used to be such an unadulterated fan of Wikipedia you know. The idea of an open source online reference that grew on a daily basis was quite an attractive one back in the day. But in recent times I've become wary of the encyclopaedia anyone can edit, and not simply because of a few high profile choice edits.

Whatever about libel and congressional cherry picking amidst the many articles of this once noble enterprise, what really gets me about Wikipedia is that I can't trust it on most issues. There are so many agendas, axes to grind and purely mischievous vandals that 90% of what I would be interested in reading about - history, politics and so on - is tripe. To read an article on a contentious subject one can pick out bias, attempted compromise and ultimate failure almost immediately. Wade into the """"Talk"""" page, where these edits are discussed, and you are confronted with chaos. There are too many vested interests at stake, and from the War on Terror to the Welfare State one will find an army of people taking one view or another entering into what are known as """"Revert Wars"""", where they revert any edits back to the version which suits them.

From self-interest to political interest one can find """"POV"""" (Point of View) shading almost every major article that touches on the live wires of our society. Thus I wouldn't trust anything that's even half-way current or ongoing on Wikipedia.

For one, the facts can be skewed. Secondly, the article can change overnight depending on how organised a campaign is launched against an article (and they do happen.)

MAGHASITO 2

USer:Maghasito try to spread of pseudo science, the so-called Hungarian Turanism , which is now a politically motivated chauvinist pseudo-science from the 19th century and a core agenda of far right Jobbik party and ww2 nazi Arrow Cross Party . There are not a single contemporary scholar (academics university professors) linguistics, historian, population geneticist on this planet, who support that fantasy theory. Wikikpedia is a free encyclopedia, however it is not the place of the popularization of pseudo-scientific politically-motivated fantastic nonsenses. The best option would be the permanent ban of Maghasito. Thank you! 

I believe that he is from a worker class family (as most of the Turanist believers), he migrated to UK or USA as a an economic-refugee due to the economic crisis. Many of this turanist boys read the esoteric pseudo-scientific  books of the so-called self-appointed turanist """"shaman-scholars"""". These shaman """"scholars"""" are usually electricians, blacksmiths, masons, car-mechanic in the real life, so they have no any university degrees. These less educated worker-class boys admired them as knowledgeable expert. Just read our discussions in the talkpage of Hungarian turanism: Forexample he consider Ferenc Zajti (shaman-scholar) as one of the greatest historian, Zajti was who invented the theory of Parthian - Hungarian Jesus. (according to Zajti Jesus Christ was not a Jew but a proto-Hungarian). These turan-believer-boys are often racist, they consider the Indo-Europeans and Semitic people and their culture as inferior and subhuman who created a very low primitive culture, and they consider the culture and race of Central Asian nomadic Turkic people as superior culture and race.

 Polymorphic male ants? 

Te section Polymorphism#Ants surprises me by claiming that polymorphism is more common among male ants than among the females. It also claims that there are non-reproductive male ants. Recalling that all I've read about ants was to the effect that the (haploid!) males sole task in the colonies is reproductive, i find this rather confusing. Could """"male"""" possibly be a misprint for """"female""""? If there is any polymorphism in male ants (apart from them taking part in the sexual dimorphism), I'd like to see a reference, or a wp link.

Conflation of the two """"brook"""" homonyms

that crosses between two other bodies of water. This may be US usage but it certainly is not of the UK. (thus """"brooking"""" them) The stream brook derives from Anglo-Saxon broc. The acceptance verb derives from AS brucan. There seems to be little connection. Also the Scottish term for a creek. It is not particularly Scottish. And has to do with creek only in the US usage. ( 08:43, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC))

 RJP was correct that the two brook homonyms were being conflated.  AHD4 says that brook the transitive verb (""""To put up with; tolerate"""") comes from Middle English brouken, from Old English brūcan, """"to use, enjoy"""". (BTW, that's interesting, because today's German verb brauchen can mean """"to use"""". Clearly cognate.)

 Meanwhile, brook the noun (""""stream"""") is a homonymous word coming from a different root, via Middle English, from Old English brōc.

  

Section was missing

is part of the article missing?  the last section is empty.  
thalweg says """"see below"""" but there is nothing there. [alex]

Changes to the article
I propose that the """"Types of water streams"""" section be changed. I have been unable to corroborate the brook definition given. The definition I found most often is a stream smaller in size than a creek. It is also used when the water source is a spring or seep. When """"stream"""" is not used in the generic sense, I've found various definitions. Some have it as being the smallest of all and some have it as just below a river. I guess we can continue only giving the generic definition.   

Better image was wanted

I feel that the first image, of a """"running stream,"""" is not very accurate, given we see water still enough for duckweed to accumulate in large amounts.  I don't doubt that it could be a flowing system, but it is hardly what I picture when I close my eyes and think """"running stream.""""  Nitpicky, yes.  

Looking at the current version of the article, this appears to have been fixed.  

 Categories suggestions 
Suggestion:  Make a category about Daylighting (streams) for neighborhoods (plese see article also—the list is already getting long), sections # Some neighborhoods with daylighting projects and # Other places.  A child article or something will eventually need be spun off.

Since each daylighted stream exists only as an intimate component of the neighborhoods of the watershed, linking the streams and neighborhoods in a category could be very useful.  Various daylighting projects exist all over the world, though so far we have Seattle, San Francisco, and Berkeley.  There exist similar projects restoring natural areas in urban settings, distinct from parks.  One is Union Bay Natural Area, another is a marsh north of San Francisco or in northern California (Eureka?) that is also providing habitat and tertiary sewage treatment, rather than having been drained.  (The most-recognized level is conventional secondary treatment.)

Suggestion:  Make a category of natural areas in urban settings.  This is tangentially related to the Georgia Basin Ecosystem Initiative at Salish Sea.

Comments, discussion?  How to tie into existing, relevant articles?

The Daylighting (streams) article could use more diverse examples

 

Stream is limited to Southern England?
I'm sorry, but the quote 'Stream is limited to Southern England,' in reference to the word 'stream' itself is total nonsense.Only the broadest of Yorkshiremen, for example, use only the word 'beck.' I am not adversed to words like these being mentioned in the stream article, but can people please try to avoid making such sweeping statements about them?  

Beck was one used in London as in Tooting bec near Wandsworth and a few Burns in Scotland are also officaly known as Streems or Brooks.  86.29.241.101

The CCSP SAP 1.1 Executive Summary states:

""""Previously reported discrepancies between the amount of warming near the surface and higher in the atmosphere have been used to challenge the reliability of climate models and the reality of humaninduced global warming. Specifically, surface data showed substantial global-average warming, while early versions of satellite and radiosonde data showed little or no warming above the surface. This significant discrepancy no longer exists because errors in the satellite and radiosonde data have been identified and corrected. New data sets have also been developed that do not show such discrepancies."""" 
The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report Summary for Policymakers states:

""""New analyses of balloon-borne and satellite measurements of lower- and mid-tropospheric temperature show warming rates that are similar to those of the surface temperature record and are consistent within their respective uncertainties, largely reconciling a discrepancy noted in the TAR.""""

I tend to agree with the NPOV concerns of some comments here.  They seem to be more along the lines of what is *not* included than what is.  To be fair, a google search returned far more of the 'critical' sources than any other.

However, I was able to make a minor edit I regard as an improvement. I replaced one Guardian article, """"Iran contra men return to power"""" with another from the same publication, the """"Negroponte: Amercia's voice of experience"""" article.

I believe the former article is redundant to many of the others, and as the least specific to Mr. Negroponte is the least relevent.  The latter article I believe balances the collective tone of the references, and does not omit mention of the Honduras accusations.

However, I have retained the old article here:

 """"Iran-contra men return to power""""(from The Guardian)

RCC lead

Thanks for the support on the RCC lead. Including this in the lead is wrong - not so much for the current wording, but that this is the thin end of the wedge that will see others want to build on that. There is a strong double-standars issue here.   

 Infoboxes 

Hi, I see you have changed infoboxes for Beverley & Market Weighton to infobox settlement. But can you please explain how this change fits in with our WP:UKCITIES standard which states """"All settlements of the United Kingdom (that are not coterminous with a local government district) are to use the Template:Infobox UK place, though some very rare exceptions exist. For those that are coterminous with a local government district (which are usually large cities / unitary districts or equivalent—such as Liverpool, Leicester, and Bristol), please use Template:Infobox settlement.""""

As for as I can determine we should be using the UK Infobox for these places not the settlement box.

  

The coat of arms added to the infobox for Beverley is not current and so should not be in the article as far as I can see.  

 Edit war and the three revert rule 

May I make you aware that the three revert rule prohibits users restoring material more than 3 times in a rolling 24 hour period. You appear to be engaged in an edit war at Beverley and are not contributing to discussion but enforcing preferences upon articles that others object to.  |  Talk   

I had a right to remove this as you do not have a consensus. Four editors have commented they do not want that infobox, whilst you have continued to revert to it. I will be reporting you for breach of 3RR (despite a warning), which may see you loose your editting privlidges. I'm also displeased with your edit summmaries and comments on talk pages which appear to be disparaging.  |  Talk   

I've reported you for 3RR. However, at this stage I must also express my concern about your comments at Talk:Market Weighton and your edits to Manchester which are incivil and distruptive respectively. This does nothing but harm Wikipedia and harm your reputation.  |  Talk   

PS please re-read WP:UKCITIES (not WP:CITIES as you keep referring to). Manchester has the distinction of being a local government district, whereas Selby etc do not. UKCITIES states that local government district ONLY should use Template:Infobox settlement. However, don't take this up with me, please resume debate at Talk:Beverley to achieve a way forwards.  |  Talk   

I think at this stage you're likely to incur a much greater block on your account as well as bring more attention to your editting style. Remember, do not distrupt Wikipedia to make a point. Your edits to Manchester are not in good faith and starkly so (you are gaming false claims of consensus). Have you not considered what maturity and respectabiliy level appears? I do not believe you are being conductive to the good of the project and I suspect you would agree. Why not rethink your approach?  |  Talk   

I was going to ask you to quote the guidance from UKCITIES that you are referring too, but I think this is a rather pointless waste of time frankly. You've done nothing to help your preferences or reputation. There's no",0

when the USSR invaded and brutally subjugated the Baltics it was not an Ally. That it was an Ally later is completely irrelevant to the situation in the Baltics and any other territories where the USSR was the initial aggressor, and you know that. (I also point out that you use later, not original, relationships to tar others but use the same to your benefit when it's good for Stalin.)
 If you wish to demonstrate some semblance of objectivity, I suggest you:
 retract your contentions of """"semi-voluntary"""" cooperation by the Baltic peoples with Nazis based on gratitude that Hitler considered them """"semi-Aryan"""" and not semi-Simian
 affirm that as far as you are concerned, the only reason Latvians et al. fought against an """"Ally"""" is because that """"Ally"""" was re-invading their homeland, and that fighting that """"Ally"""" had nothing to do whatsoever with the expression of sympathies for the Nazi cause.
 Absent of these two actions on your part, I cannot consider your presence here and participation in this conversation in particular as being in anything resembling good faith.
 Regarding Poland, let's see, 51% of territory to Stalin, 49% of territory to Hitler = Stalin wound up with more of Poland than Hitler. So, your personal attack that I'm lying is, unfortunately, a lie.
 As for your contention that Stalin """"saved"""" Jews, with respect to the Baltics at least, Jews were deported to Siberia by the USSR in a greater proportion of population than any other ethnic group and to harsher conditions, as Stalin was a rabid anti-Semite. Your history is flawed there as well. That some Jews escaped owing to circumstance had nothing to do with Stalin being beneficent to Jews, he plainly was not.  ►TALK

 Unreliable sources misquotes source 

Your source for the extirpation by whalers of the Atlantic gray whales is suspect. Among the two sources it cites is Bryant's 1995 paper on Atlantic gray whale specimens. Bryant (p. 860, right column) merely speculates that whaling may have been the cause of its disappearance, stating that """"This population of gray whales apparently disappeared during periods of active coastal whaling on both sides of the North Atlantic, supporting the possibility [my italics] that whaling activities were responsible for, or at least contributed to, its extinction"""". However, these whaling activities (as far as we know) primarily targeted right whales, as I stated above. Earlier (p. 860, left column) he asks """"Could the eastern North Atlantic gray whale have been extirpated by whaling activities? Unfortunately, early whaling activities off the coast of Europe are poorly documented.""""

Personally I'm not as it really seems like we're portraying Donohue's characterizations as valid. Give Donohue (which essentially is the Catholic League) credit as he is a seasoned p.r. and talk show veteran and seems to know what hot buttons to push and how. However if we are going to give him a platform I would feel better if we broke down the section into the major points with balancing statements so the readers can easily see the issues dissected and addressed. To me the section feels like a several-headed beast each adding a sentence onto the next with the net result of confusion. I suggest sections including one devoted to just the League's issues (if it's just them) so we don't infer because the League said X then Y happened. In my opinion Donohue speaks as if he's representing Catholics and is actually seen by many Catholics as an extremist (I'm not sure if right-wing is accurate) who's actually feeding anti-Catholicism by perpetuating stereotypes in pop culture arenas while ignoring concerns of mainstream Catholics. I may not be wording this in the best way but I think the gist is there. Benjiboi,0

"Wow...you hold a masters degree in economics and have taken many doctoral courses? Is that supposed to impress us? Most professional economists are on the payroll of the FED, so of course they reject Austrian economics. AE is, however, the oldest continual school of economic thought. Moreover, it doesn't have the dismal track record of mainstream economics, which, to quote Bill Maher, is a litany of getting shit dead wrong. From the Wall Street crash 1929, to the non-existent depression of 1946, to the Bretton Woods system, the stagflation of the 1970s, the S&L; crisis of the 1980s, the dot.com bubble of the 1990s and the housing bubble of the 2000s. From Keynes' suggestion to bury FED-notes in glass jars underground and let people dig them up, to Samuelson's insistence on the USSR overtaking the US from the early 1970s to 1989, to Krugman's Space Alien Invasion solution to our present day crisis.
Just to name a few examples of the top of my head. With a track record like that, of course they will shun the one school of thought that get things right, that understand what economics actually is and, more importantly, what it isn't.
It's not the mainstream economists that don't take AE seriously, it's the other way around. For good reason. So excuse me for not being all giggly about your supposed training in economics. Like Jefferson said, you'd be better informed of current events if you didn't read any newspaper at all than if you read those of his day. Likewise, you're likely to have a far better understanding of economics if you've never taken an economics course than having spent years studying Keynesianism, monetarism, neoclassicism or whatever mishmash of mainstream schools that gets taught in the universities today.",0

While diglossia as a field of research or even the concept might have flowered long past Caldwell, its quite inconceivable that Caldwell would have been unaware of this diglossia.  Infact, in speaking about the difficulty that the untrained or sometimes even the trained Tamil(and I certainly and strongly feel that he is talking about people who have received their training in Tamil Nadu.  I dont think he would have based his views or book on somebody who learnt or spoke Tamil in say, Germany or France in the mid 19th century) faces, Caldwell is speaking about nothing but diglossia, maybe without putting it down in as many words.

Be that as it may, what studies in diglossia in Tamil over the last several decades would have done is merely deal with the 'problem' in greater detail and throw light on such things as the causes for diglossia, 'evolution', perpetuation etc., of this phenomenon over the centuries and other things of academic interest like that.

What I am trying to say is, while scientific interest and research into diglossia might be a development of the last few decades, 'diglossia'(in tamil) existed nonetheless, even before that.  And like I said, Caldwell has only touched upon it though not gone deeper into it to research the more intricate details of it.

Notwithstanding that, the fact remains that the ordinary Tamil, especially one without formal(or informal) training, is often at a loss to understand Classical tamil enough to fully appreciate its beauty.

so, imo, the lines that are already there should be retained as it is.  But, you should also(before those lines, preferably) make a mention of the diglossia that exists in Tamil, the different levels, the continuum etc., and then conclude that... """"....as a result of the said diglossia, the ordinary Tamil, sometimes even with formal training, is at a loss to understand the language of classical literature(or the other diglossic levels)""""

And, to answer Sundar's question as to whether (I feel) this is limited to just Tamil or is also a feature of other languages -

While I dont a 'professional grade' knowledge of any language, I've had formal schooling in both Kannada and Hindi.  And I've observed this feature in both languages, much more so in Kannada.  In Kannada, in fact, if you were to study the 'Mankutimmana Kagga'(written sometime in the 60s or 70s i guess) by D V Gundappa, the language used is somewhat in haLegannaDa style, though I would say, it doesnt 'sound' as haLe(old) as haLegannada.  I am able to understand this work for the most part except in some places where it gets a little too much for me and I might have to refer to the dictionary.

Any literature, regardless of when it was written, but written in pure haLegannada style, I would say, wouldnt make much sense to the untrained eye or ear.  

With Hindi, probably because the language is much younger than Kannada or Tamil, though I've observed a sort of diglossia, say in the language that Kabir employs, verses that of Munshi or someone,  Kabir is far more discernable to me than say the Kavirajamarga would be to me or probably Kural to you.

In general, I feel some degree of diglossia almost always exists in most languages(atleast Indian languages) in that, the lingo employed by news readers, say,(atleast in the good old 'Doordarshan only' days), is removed from the one you would hear on the street.  Talking of newsreaders and the lingo on street, I just remembered an interesting thing about the Kannada spoken by the people of South Kanara.  It is almost exactly like the one employed in the news or in formal documents, in that, they speak much the same way they and the rest of Karnataka would write.  I am not sure if there's a parallel to this in Tamil or any other language that I have any knowledge of.

To Derild4921 and Sadads: If your main dispute is the sourcing with the original article then why did you not contact me, as I could have provided the additional source material - you can see from my contributions I just author Tunnels books on here. As I said above all the content of the original article is completely accurate and can be verified. I have provided a number of source links to justify that. Should I need more, no problem just advise me. As far as I can see I did broadly meet the Notability standards. This may not be in the GA format that you are looking for, but as Wikipedia content relies on volunteers passionate about their article subject, I feel you should be more supportive. As I confirmed above it was me who asked for the reassessment, only at that stage, a few days ago, did you offer to 'help' improve my article. The new article you created in your Sandbox, then only remains there for 1 day before you either lose the content or publish it - hardly enough time for me to discuss my objections about your new proposal to remove my article. To replace my article when you have not even finished reading Tunnels is ridiculous - surely any author on Wikipedia should at least have read the novel first, not sure how that can meet your verifiable Notability standards! That aside I have already correctly embarrassing errors concerning incorrect publishing dates and versions, wrong character and place names like Stynx and Hightail (not a one off). Others that come to mind include: The official publication date for the US Tunnels was January 2008 - it might have been that copies were available on Amazon earlier than that date, but that often happens in the UK and US. Nearly all territories have gone on to publish Deeper, and only a handful haven't yet published Freefall (mainly due to their own financial difficulties, and not because the performance of the series hasn't merited it!) - you can check this on the publishers website http://www.doublecluck.com/rights. The authors changed the title with Barry Cunningham - this article makes it sound as though he did it off his own back! There are two versions of the audiobook in the UK (the Davenport one is abridged), and also the American and German unabridged versions. Chester isn't """"about to killed"""" under SETTING - he is sentenced to go into the Interior! The Plot emphasis is all wrong and does not give a true insight into the overall storyline. The Setting and Plot areas you have changed are so badly written - and I am well aware of my own average writing abilities, but in comparison this new version lacks significant maturity. References to the Highfield Mole are confusing. Barry is now Barry Cunningham OBE, and there's no question that he signed JK Rowling for her first two Harry Potter books whilst he was employed by Bloomsbury. I would like my article reinstated and with your expert help and support I would like to improve and expand my sources, and thus improve my own knowledge of Wikipedia article standards. My priority is not, however, achieving GA status at the expense of diminished quality or informative reading. I do have the support of the UK fansite team on this. The authors have often been kind enough to verify and supply content for my article. Following my notification about your changes, they have emailed me their confirmation that they would also like to see the original version restored. I await your response. Thanks (  )""",0

""""Omega and Chaos""""

In a certain mythology not known as of yet... omega and chaos are believed to be spirits of the Earth. Omega being the """"protector"""" or """"guardian"""" of Earth, and chaos being the """"armageddon"""" or """"end"""" of Earth.
Supposodely when chaos and desolence is about the Earth or is bought forth upoun the Earth Omega is awakened to balance out the excess...

And vice versa is omega awakens with the goal of sending the planet to the """"stars"""" chaos comes to balance out the excess... so there isn't really a bad guy in this situation...

Whatever  this has precisely nothing to do with the topic of """"Alpha and Omega (Christianity)"""". Go to Alpha and Omega (disambiguation) and see if anything there is relevant (if you can document your assertions, of course...)  

Omega is NOT """"protector"""" NOR """"guardian"""" of Earth, because Sampi instead really bears this function. Remember that Greek alphabet has over 30 letters. 91.94.153.30  
....this guy is just spewing from Final Fantasy VII: Dirge of Cerberus. Koromon survived intact. 

Alpha and Sampi

Full global Greek alphabet is as follows:

Α Β Γ Δ Ε Ϝ Ϛ Ζ Η Ͱ Θ Ι Κ Λ Μ Ν Ξ Ο Π Ϻ Ϸ Ϟ Ρ Σ Τ Υ Φ Χ Ψ Ω Ͳ

It begins with Alpha, and ends with Sampi. That means that Omega in this case is not final letter, because after Omega is placed too Sampi. Due to this fact, in this case God is not only local Ionian Alpha and Omega, because He is in this case too Somebody more - global Pan-Greek Alpha and Sampi. This fact should be acknowledged by all Christians that uses global Greek Alphabet, because in this case they can diminish God by excluding Him from full range of global Greek Alphabet. Ionians were justified by their unknowledge, and Jesus only adjusted Himself to their lower level of knowledge, calling Himself as local Ionian Beginning and End. Sho was placed between San and Qoppa and was only existing Greek letter not used by Greeks, but by Bactrians that adopted Greek alphabet. Comparison page is here.  

I'm sorry, but """"Sampi"""" was a kludge whereby a corrupt form of an archaic letter (formerly between Pi and Qoppa) was dragged in so that there would be 27 distinct symbols for the purposes of Isopsephy, while Sho was used in Central Asia to transcribe non-Greek languages. Neither of these symbols was ever used as a letter to write the Greek Koine language (which is the only thing which is relevant for the Bible).  

Thus that would mean that Sampi was corrupted version of San, that is placed between Pi and Qoppa.  

Probably it was (though there is still some debate over the matter). But regardless of its origin, it still was never used as a letter to write the Greek Koine language (which is the only thing that's relevant for this article).  

Because T-shaped alphabetic Sampi was introduced recently to Wikipedia, I think that it is in T-shape not corrupted, but fully fledged letter. For proof look into Sampi article to compare alphabetic T-Sampi and numeric C-Sampi. As you see, T-Sampi is more like russian П and too Greek PI, with addition of |, while C-Sampi is more like russian Э and too Greek LUNATE EPSILON, with addition of -. In this way T-Sampi should be primary, and C-Sampi secondary. CBMIBM  
It's a fully-fledged numerical symbol, but it wasn't a """"letter"""", and it's not relevant to this article.   
T-shaped Sampi was really alphabetic letter with ss value, what is stated even in Greek alphabet article in obsolete letter section, but C-shaped Sampi is mainly numerical symbol derived from previous alphabetic symbol. CBMIBM  
In other words, it was probably a medieval manuscript ligature (disigma, or sigma-sigma) identified at a late period with an archaic numerical symbol (sampi)  as was exactly the case with the medieval manuscript ligature stigma (sigma-tau) identified at a late period with an archaic numerical symbol (digamma).  However, the New Testament period chronologically preceded the peri",0

 Some minor revisions to the 1st paragraph of the """"Definition"""" section. 

An obviously jumbled word somehow crept into the beginning of the 2nd sentence of the paragraph:  """"The formula useoefficients of price elasticity....""""  I put in a proposed revision.  

I also changed """"quantity"""" to """"quantity demanded"""" for the sake of clarity and completeness. It's crucial that the definition be as precise as possible in emphasizing that PED is concerned only with changes in quantity demanded.  (Elasticity is one of the most difficult concepts in micro for most beginning students and for other potential readers/users  WP's """"customers""""; they tend to get confused by the slightest ambiguity about which quantity we mean.  An ounce of emphasis here doesn't preclude such confusion, but it can help avoid a pound of it.)

In addition, I added """"services"""" to the definition as a token reminder that PED, as well as the laws of supply and demand, apply to both goods and services.

The only other noteworthy revision was to the beginning of the last sentence in the first paragraph to place more emphasis on the PED for the most typical types of goods and services.  Although the Giffen and Veblen exceptions are interesting, they are almost negligibly rare anomalies compared to the overwhelming number of typical goods and services governed by the Law of Demand.  (That's why it merits the rare status of a """"Law""""!)  The exceptions deserve discussion eventually (in a later section), but I think this introductory paragraph would be strengthened by giving them only the briefest possible mention in passing here.  Instead, this paragraph should focus attention on the crux of the issue that readers need to remember (the """"take-away""""), namely:  because the demand for most goods and services obeys the Law of Demand, their PED coefficients will always be negative.  

Again, elasticity is one of the most difficult topics at the introductory level of microeconomics.  It doesn't serve this section or the article well to risk distracting students and other readers from the main point too early with such minor exceptions, however interesting they may be to the intellectually curious readers. Once we've made the main point as clear as possible, then devoting some time to the exceptions is much less likely to cause confusion or ambiguity.
  
I have one more suggested revision along this line for the paragraph, and I'll return to it as soon as time permits.

I made a few other copyedits were purely minor, e.g., deleting an occasional unnecessary word to polish the prose just a bit.

"Combining options 1 and 3
Point taken about the importance of the ecological roots. Here's a re-working, re-inserting that:

Sustainability, in a very general sense, is the capacity to maintain a certain process or state indefinitely. However, over the last 50 years or so in recent years the concept has been applied more specifically to living organisms and systems, and to humanity in general. As applied to the human community, sustainability has been expressed as This is sometimes expressed through the idea of meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.

Sustainability requires that human activity only uses nature’s resources at a rate at which they can be replenished naturally. The term has its roots in ecology as the ability of an ecosystem to maintain ecological processes, functions, biodiversity and productivity into the future. There is now clear scientific evidence that humanity is living unsustainably by consuming the Earth’s limited natural resources more rapidly than they are being replaced by nature. Consequently, for many people, sustainability has come to mean a call for action, for a collective human effort to keep human use of natural resources within the Earth’s finite resource limits.

Sustainability has become a controversial and complex all-purpose term  that is widely applied in many different ways: to different levels of biological organization (e.g.sustainable e.g.,wetlands, gardens, prairies, forests), to different levels of human organization (sustainable households, (e.g., ecovillages, eco-municipalities, sustainable cities) towns, sustainable countries) and to human activities and disciplines and more {e.g., (sustainable agriculture, sustainable architecture sustainable economics).

Article Evaluation 
For this assignment, I was tasked to analyze and comment on the article about Change Management. The first paragraph includes useful and clear overview of the topic, however, it could use a little more information that would broaden the interests of readers. They key points in this article are based on historical occurrences that have contributed to rapid changing events in the workforce and that also created a standard for change management in a way. The information includes sufficient information regarding the history and the context of this topic. It most definitely covers a variety of topics, including the reasons for such change. In addition to that, the article addresses the key issues including globalization and technology that have heavily influenced change management. There is therefore well supported evidence throughout the article and the analysis of certain models proves that the article is referenced and can be proven with contextual information. 
The article itself has a clear focus on a topic and also includes detailed scholarly support throughout the text, which can be found in the reference section. The contribution considers a variety of perspectives, however, I think it primarily focuses on today’s rapidly changing world, in reference towards globalization and technology and maybe could focus more than just a few scholars. It takes an appropriate tone in providing points of view in the context of globalization and technology and is supported with appropriate references throughout the page. I think for this article there are sufficient references but more references can always be beneficial and offer more content. 
The article represents a neutral point of view but in a way is sort of drawn towards today’s issues in terms of globalization and technology and offers a certain point of view. It does a good job staying with the facts and avoiding opinions. In terms of article length, the only thing I would suggest is a longer intro with a little more information for the reader to have. 
Overall, it’s a well written entry with detailed information about change management. I couldn’t find any grammatical errors or any misspellings and the text itself reads well and expresses good ideas. In terms of structure, I would only add more information to the introduction to give the reader more background knowledge.",0

First, NPOV is only violated by you.

It are simply facts. Most parties in Europe are Anti-EU, but even if not, why would that be a reason not to mention the parties who speculate about withdrawal??

 I agree with User:Man with two legs that the graph is extremely misleading.  See this quote about (or maybe from?) Edward Tufte:
 Before the development of spreadsheet graphing, the most common graphical mistake was the use of artist-drawn 3-D images with the height of 3-D objects representing the magnitude of the data points.  In these charts, both the height and the width of the drawn object increase proportionate to the magnitude of the data points.  The effect is to exaggerate the differences in magnitude as the viewer tends to perceive the area of the figures rather than just the height as representing the magnitude. (Source)
 The image suggests that the Tsar Bomba, which was three or four times more powerful than Castle Bravo, is actually 40 times larger in volume (or ~10x larger in area).  If explosion volume went up by about the cube of the yield (not really accurate, but much closer than this chart) the Tsar Bomba mushroom cloud would be 1.5x taller than Castle Bravo and 15x taller than Hiroshima.  Instead, the diagram shows the CB and TB over a thousand times taller.  

 On this scale, one could conclude that since the Hiroshima bombing's mushroom cloud was about four miles high, the Tsar Bomba explosion (3,000x taller) must be larger than the Earth itself.  98.218.195.90  12:41, 6 July 2010",0

User:A930913, User:Dru_of_Id, User:Legoktm, User:Bgwhite 

I appreciate the computer's catching three syntax errors in the article https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1st_Aerospace_Control_Squadron.  These have been around several years but it is good to know about them.

They occur in the lists of personnel at 1st Aero, their job descriptions (showing now jobs were defined and allocated to different ranks), and the courses offered as training in the development of the squadron's activities for the first formative years.  However, a few days ago, I had occasion to look at the article and saw that, last year, someone had removed all  this detailed personnel information except for the list of Squadron Commanders.  I restored this information recently, but it has again been removed with the comment by BB-PB

grossly excessive level of detail - none of these people are notable

It is a matter of opinion whether, as trackers of man-made satellite, people who have done things that have never before been done in human history are or are not notable.

Is there any way to appeal this decision on the grounds that the listing provides useful historical detail not available elsewhere about the organizational progress of early satellite tracking in the US?  My Ph.D. is in Management Theory so I think this is worthwhile information that should not be suppressed.

I removed the list of Commanders (as that is trivial compared to the other information) and inserted this remark):

""""The historical development of the Squadron is shown by detailed listings of personnel with dates and citations. However, a Wikipedia monitor refuses to allow this level of detail. Copies of the information are available on request from the author.""""
The list of commanders has again been restored, repacing my comment, and I have removed it as they are not notable  it is the workers who did something special.
But the commanders are again restored.

If an appeal is permitted, please tell me how to do that.  seaotter6@aol.com""",0

Of course, the unique relationship between Christian Poles and Polish Jews is duly noted as causing your perception.  Most people consider the Poles as superfriendly to Jews, but in fact the Polish commoners had no special like for Jews.  These common misperceptions would be best cleared up, if you kept all terms neutral as possible.  We don't need people getting upset and wanting to fight back and forth.  Your own feelings about being discriminated against by inconsiderate Jews going on their rants about the Holocaust, don't belong in the focus of an article.  You have every right to feel upset about the Blitzkrieg and Nazi occupation of your land, including your upset attitude in being slighted by the ignorance of foreigners who think that damage to your people was neglible or meaningless.  It is their ignorance and apathy that keeps them from forgetting about your loss, but Poles don't shove guilt upon the world about the Holocaust as many Jews seem to do.  Take it from me.

 Articles for deletion/Fruit (slang) 

Copy deemed personal attack and removed from discussion page:  I believe that LtPowers was coerced into making his statement of defense. Here's how it happened: the fruity editor Benjiboi seeks to impose her queer agenda here at WP, i.e., to include anything and everything related to queerdom whether or not it's notable or sourced. Any editor who questions her edits, additions, ideas, etc., whether or not warranted, is branded a homophobe, or a homophobic vandal (whom she must """"fight""""). Instead of defending her work on the strength of its merits, apparent or lacking, she cleverly, and sometimes not subtly, transforms the issue to: """"if you're not with me, you're against me!"""" And so the focus of the discussion here shifted from whether to include her work to whether Powers is a homophobe, and how dare Powers attack sick, tired Benjiboi. And this arouses everybody's sympathies for poor, poor Benjiboi. Yeah, now it's """"I'm on a break, I'm off to rest from fighting those (omnipresent) homophobic vandals."""" What's next?  """"My white count is way off (so give me what I want)"""" or how about """"I'm throwing up my meds (so let me have my article)?"""" Oh, and how commendable that she still edits here while on break from battle  what dedication! Look, I'll say one thing for Benjiboi: she is a skillful manipulator.

 list of interpretations 

From my reading of it, the third item in this list doesn't fit with the way the list is introduced:

The contemporary scholarly debate about race and intelligence involves both the relatively uncontroversial experimental results that indicate that average IQ test scores vary among racial groups, and the relatively more controversial interpretations of these IQ differences. In general, contemporary interpretations of the """"IQ gap"""" can be divided into three broad categories:

 """"culture-only"""" or """"environment-only"""" interpretations that posit only non-genetic causes (e.g., socioeconomic inequality or minority culture membership) that differentially affect racial groups; and
 """"partly genetic"""" interpretations that posit an IQ gap between racial groups caused by approximately the same matrix of genetic and environmental forces that cause IQ differences among individuals of the same race.
 """"insufficient data"""": no meaningful interpretation can be made based on available evidence.

The problem seems to be that #3 isn't an interpretation, but rather the lack of an interpretation or the inability to empirically distinguish between alternatives #1 and #2. I've been brainstorming for a simple fix, but I can't think of one. The best alternative I can think of is to remove #3 from the list and add a follow up sentence saying something like """"a large minority think there is insufficient data and no meaningful interpretation can be made based on available evidence"""".

 Exactly why this article should be deleted 
Since some editors have deplorable difficulty understanding (as ITAQALLAH laments """"but on the talk page never explains in detail how the content is in accordance with policy, and ignores any policies that I may cite"""") why this article deserves to be deleted, I will once more explain now being very precise and exact so that you may be cleared of all doubts.

The article (in its post-censorsed state) is in violation of WP:BLP.
Let me quote from it: 

Editors must take particular care adding biographical material about a living person to any Wikipedia page. Such material requires a high degree of sensitivity, and must adhere strictly to all applicable laws in the United States and to all of our content policies, especially:

 Neutral point of view (NPOV)
 Verifiability
 No original research

This article violates requirement number One: Neutral point of view (NPOV)

Now for idiotic editors (like those who childishly colour their usernames) who will have difficulty comprehending how on earth this article violates NPOV (owing to their idiocy, which I hope Eugenics will fix one day) let me quote section 2.5 from the NPOV page:

Balance

When reputable sources contradict one another, the core of the NPOV policy is to let competing approaches exist on the same page: work for balance, that is: describe the opposing viewpoints according to reputability of the sources, and give precedence to those sources that have been the most successful in presenting facts in an equally balanced manner.

It says """"describe the opposing viewpoints"""". And where does this article do that ???
Rather than describe describe the opposing viewpoints, it suppresses opposing viewpoints.

This is why the article is biased, censorsed and therefore must be deleted.

I will be re-inserting the PROD tag in 24 hours if no one can come up with an argument that justifies having a biased viewpoint or can explain why and how the """"describe the opposing viewpoints"""" requirement is insignificant enough to be ignored. -   """,0

I am not taking advice from either of you.  This is a conversation between me and the administrator. The only problem I see is that obnoxious and confrontational editors like Verbal are given free reign, and in the process they drive other editors off the site.  I've offered my advice:  (1) stop valuing the input of Wiki-addicts like Verbal, and start valuing the input of productive editors; (2) place a daily limit on the number of posts to discourage Wiki-addiction; and (3) ask editors not to make extensive edits to subjects they know nothing about.  Until that is done, the warring on Wikipedia will continue, and knowledgeable editors will continue to be driven off the site  and the articles will suffer.  23:03",0

Night: Here's your cite, which actually addresses several of your wishes: WP Biographies of Living Persons. You should look especially to: """"Using the subject as a self-published source"""" - it states that """"the article is not based primarily on such sources."""". Thirteen of your eighteen source references are to Pedro and Me, or Winick's personal sites (yes, IMDB counts). For example, you cite the book as the reason for keeping in the discussion of Rainey, while I repeat-it's an isolated, non-turning-point event in his life. It is appropriate for the Real World page, perhaps, but here it's a little off-topic. You might as well put in the name of a flavor of ice cream he doesn't like, or that someone was mean to him in middle school. It's just not important enough for what should be a short bio. And a link to Zamora's bio can cover his illness, a mention that he had HIV/AIDS and was ill covers him quite nicelythere's no need to go into it, except for the impact it had on Winick.

"It was just an example of another an apolitical use of the term. There are others, I just don't remember any specifically. While I don't debate the inherent ties to right-wing politics, the lack of a dictionary definition, the popular usage of the term, as well as the inherent ridiculousness of the word itself make it hard to relate to an one political affiliation exclusively. But the main problem with the wording of the article's intro is that it doesn't specify the context of the political usage. It says feminazi refers to feminists who are preceived as intolerant of conservative views, which implies the word refers to any feminist who opposes any form of conservativism. I think it should be limited to conservative views on gender roles or something along those lines. The word would be used to refer to a feminist who was campaigning against fiscal conservativism or the War in Iraq unless there was some clear tie between these views and his/her views on gender equality. 69.85.216.191",0

"Evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo) refers to the study of developmental programs and patterns from an evolutionary perspective.  It seeks to understand the various influences shaping the form and nature of life on the planet. Evo-devo arose as a separate branch of science only in the last decade. Most of the synthesis in evo-devo has been in the field of animal evolution, one reason being the presence of elegant model systems like Drosophila, C.elegans, Zebrafish and Xenopus. However, in the past couple of decades, a wealth of information on plant morphology, coupled with modern molecular techniques has helped shed light on the conserved and unique developmental patterns in the plant kingdom also.",0

{{unblock|reason=Block serves no purpose. Given that my so-called PAs were limited to AN/I, and that I am preparing a case for RfC/U then I am hardly likely to persist. Further to the point that remarks on AN/I that are not related to content disputes are not disruptive, and therefore the block is not preventative, as there are, and have been, no concerns regarding disruption or vandalise to encyclopedic articles. My argument stands that this block is a WP:COATRACK with my """"personal attacks"""" being highlighted to mask the uncivil remarks and assertions on AN/I. Those assertions, based on undue lack of AGF, over my response to a WQA are based on straw man arguments, with no evidence to support the claims, and in fact run on a parallel track to the discussion at AN/I, but have in fact been misrepresented through synthesis to create an attack on my contribs, and cannot be reasonably analysed as a """"bad faith"""" WQA response. However, this is the tone that has been used by an admin who refused to get involved in the WQA, but did not hesitate to question my ability to respond to the WQA, which was also, notably, my first WQA response, which was concluded and closed by supporting editors. Therefore the attack on my response, which was made prematurely, perhaps an uncivil approach in itself, was unfounded. Since the close, the admin has refused to recognise their critique as a bad faith attack, nor have they refactored it recognise the conclusion of the WQA. They have, instead, used my earlier uncivil remarks, which I should not pre-dated the AN/I topic by 3 days and therefore the admins right to question my WQA response was somewhat presumptious given that the two events are unrelated, and casting doubts on an editors ability to contribute to X-area of wiki because they had a dispute in Y-area of wiki is not a logical conclusion, it is a straw man argument; i.e. """"Because MB was uncivil to editor-A on AN/I, he should be kept away from WQA"""". This flaw being, that every article, user, project and content page on wiki has a discussion page, therefore why not argue """"If MB is uncivil on AN/I, he could be uncivil anywhere""""? Having dismissed the admins argument as flawed, based in this discrepancy, plus the fact they were assuming I would respond to WQA, but it had been my first and there is no evidence to suggest I was going to make a career out of it, the admin drew conclusion based on a false premis. Those conclusions were used detrimentally and matter-of-fact, despite being opinions, theories and at most, concerns. At no time did the admin attempt to address those concerns on my talk page, as would be proper. Instead they made uncivil remarks, questioning the faith of my response and promoting a damning claim, using quotes out of context and lacking correct interpretation. I maintain that the intentions of the admin were uncivil, and that by addressing me """"potentially uncivil"""" the admin was making proactive disdainful remarks, based on one solitary WQA, rather than a reactive proposal based on sufficient history, behaviour patterns or evidence to support the theory. To make matters worse, when I confronted the admin with this they adopted a defensive stance, dismissing my anger at their assertions as uncivil, and convoluted the matter further by placing my angry response above their own behaviour, whilst casting judgement, thus clouding the issue, i.e. the WP:COATRACK counter-measure. I consider this an attack on my integrity, as my response to WQA was rejected and questioned before it was even resolved, which is a clear example of attacking the faith of an editor. Because the admin continued to accelerate their case against me with condescending remarks, and refusal to accept their straw man claim as unreasonable or irrelevant to the discussion, i.e. a fork. Their persistence to use those comments can only be observed as advocating. For any admin of that experience to be unable to recognise their own bad faith, illogical attempt to predict an editor, and close-minded approach, there has to be a underlying motive, in my belief, for them to persist, to the degree of blocking me and refusing to allow their behaviour to be questioned is paramount to enacting COI.  So, though my responses may be considered uncivil, they are in reaction to what I perceive as irresponsible admin attitude, and pessimistic misuse of my response at WQA. That is not a PA, or uncivil, it is a legit observation with regards my POV which was made to look warped due to the late-interjection with straw man based propositions, casting aspersions on my ability to handle WQA. Unless there has been a direct complaint or issue pertaining to a page, or discussion, it is not appropriate for an admin to imply anything, and therefore my one-off role at WQA is",0

 I think having wikipedia in here sounds like a good idea, at least because it seems to me that wikipedia is a very well-known example of free culture. That wikipedia is a part of free culture should be pretty self-apparent from the way it's defined in the article (""""social movement[s] that [promote] the freedom to distribute and modify creative works, using the Internet as well as other media""""), and from the license used.
 The self-referencing seems ok, as the text says that writing about wikipedia is ok where it's relevant. If wikipedia is an example of online free culture, then it's relevant.
 As for wikipedia not using copyrighted material without permission, I don't see that as any stranger than FLOSS not gobbling up proprietary software. Free culture things are things that let you copy, distribute and modify them. Proprietary things generally don't, and so using them without permission isn't allowed, and therefore you can't include them in free culture things and have the free culture things remain free (or even legal). If you want to use copyrighted pictures and such on wikipedia, it seems to me that is to ask the owner to change the license, or at least follow fair usage guidelines.   """,0

Content issues

There are emerging guidelines within the Indigenous peoples WikiProject that I have begun to apply across the board for BC First Nations.  The main one is that there are different types of articles, even when their content and location/people may seem to overlap (I'll sign each section/paragraph so comments on specific points can be made easily: 
""""Ethno & Culture"""" articles
Not as loose as it sounds, despite having to describe it like this: """"ethno/history/culture/peoples""""
which this article, as titled, would fit into.  These articles get Category:First Nations in British Columbia, with """"First Nation"""" here meant in an ethnic sense, not in a governmental-org one.  Ideally these will always be simply named, without """"Nation"""" appended, as with Secwepemc and Nuu-chah-nulth - or Stó:lō  (variable forms like Nuu-chah-nulth-aht can be redirects, although that term can include the Pacheedaht which normally wouldn't want to be called Nuu-chah-nulth). 
Government articles
bands/First Nations, tribal councils, treaty groups) which have government-related content, ranging from chiefs and councillors, affiliations, treaty issues, modern demographics, economic and social issues, and so on  These articles get Category:First Nations governments in British Columbia.  In the case of the Stó:lō the main government article is going to be (created in a few minutes...): Stó:lō Nation, and will list all its subgovernments; """"Indian Band"""" and """"First Nation"""", sometimes just """"Nation"""" are all interchangeable, although some bands seem to have a preference (at different times, given by variable content on various website sources); whatever is picked.  Non-Indian Act-based governments can be and should described under different titles, either in the ethno type or in the history type (see below) 
language articles
'nuff said, but can be titled either in native language (St'at'imcets) or in the form Shuswap language; Wiki guidelines, it should be stressed, prefer the latter (use English, which is the language of the encyclopedia...).  Some ethno and gov articles will have more than one language listed in their cats; some languages span more than one gov group, or in the case of the Sto:lo and Chehalis, two different ones.  Cats for this are specialized in the linguistics hierarchy (examples later), but they should generally all take the relevant nation-category if there is one Category:Secwepemc, Category:Stó:lō, Category:Syilx etc. 
Community/Reserve articles
Communities, reserves/IRs, towns that have significant native presence also; there is a difference, note, between the physical object of a reserve, and the band government that runs it; the descrption of the reserve is here, that of the government; even though this will not just overlap with the government articles but also the ethno/peoples ones; just interlink everything and it will sort of make sense; it's just a question of what was being searched for; the Scw'exmx and Spaxomin bands are all listed under Nicola Tribal Association, for instance; but the latter article is about the association, not about the communities; similarly, Shackan and Nooaitch are communities as well as reserves, but articles about them should focus on the community's particular history, not on overall Scw'exmx culture.  In the case of the Sto:lo, there is another issue of """"where to fit the Chehalis"""" as they are in the same cultural/language area, but they are not Sto:lo by organization or by their own appellation.  Or the Tsleil-wau-tuth who are culturally Skxwxu7mesh but are part of the Sto:lo Nation (or were, last time I looked); so there's some confusing bits here and there.
""""Mythology"""" articles
User:OldManRivers has pointed out the """"mythology"""" articles and the cats that go with them; awkward wording/titling but in the absence of anything more workable, that's all there is for now.
History/Biography articles
there is another sort-of category for specific history articles, e.g. Chilcotin War, Fraser Canyon War and various bio articles (Simon Gunanoot, Slumach, Klattasine etc.) where Category:First Nations history would be appropriate as well as either Category:First Nations leaders or Category:First Nations persons; there's also different cats like Category:Conflicts in Canada which may apply, or Category:Wars involving indigenous peopels in North America, which was specifically titled to allow inter-native wars as well as wars between native peoples and non-natives; and without the """"Native American"""" wording that that category at one time had",0

 stradbroke galleon etc 

Hallo Hesperian
Just thought I should send you a copy of my comments on the end of your little witch hunt. Yes you won, bully for you, I hope it makes you feel like a big man. I look forward to when I bump into you in the flesh so we can sort this out the old fashioned way; face to face. that will be fun!!!

hallo Moondyne, I do admit that when I signed onto Wikipedia I was not aware that it was a concensus community of knowledge Nazis but now that I am aware of it I will make the appropriate adjustments. I was under the obviously mistaken impression that Wikipedia was a venue for sharing facts, knowledge and information. The notion that the Stradbroke Galleon story is a pet theory of mine is total rubbish as it has been written about, discussed and investigated for more than 100 years by historians and historical groups such as the Royal Historical Society of Queensland, the Maritime Archaeology Association of Queensland and many more too numerous to include here. There exists, in various libraries, books and communities a large body of written and oral history concerning the galleon story which I have attempted to fairly and accurately place in the WP domain. The fact that a story is not accepted by """"mainstream"""" academics is not a valid reason for deletion of either of my contributions. What has occured here is a classic example of manipulation of an information resource by a vested interest group (i.e. Hesperian and his friends) who are representatives of the """"mainstream"""" view. Hesperian complain about the media coverage I have recieved but this never appeared in any of the WP contributions I made and Hesperian's mention of the media coverage demonstrates the core reason for Hesperian's antagonistic attitude, simple, old fashioned professional jealousy. Thus valid historical data is being deliberately surpressed by Hesperian for personal reasons. For example the Portuguese walking stick handle which was found in an Aboriginal midden, identified by a Spanish Musuem offical and story told to me by a UQ Archaeology PhD student is very relevant to the theory of the Portuguese discovery of Australia. This kind of knowledge suppression is not what Wiki is about but I guess you do not care as you appear to be part of the happy little click or have been sucked in by Hesperian and his little band of mates, which is a pity, but history is full of the suppression of information by vested interest groups so why should I expect Wiki be any different. Still it is dissapointing. Happy trails. Gregjay (talk)

 Dispute with section on device drivers 

I would change it, but I know that x86 drivers that are user mode can be used in Windows x64 8. I can in fact provide proof that this is the case. I have a Mayflash 3 in 1 Magic joy box that comes with a driver for the three controllers it has. While the Gamecube and PS2 don't install the driver in device manager, the Xbox does require it. There is only x86 drivers right now, but I can assure you that X86 drivers can run in Windows X64, provided they do not run in Kernel mode. Presumably, this driver is User mode, which Microsoft allows. It is also unsigned, but Windows X64 installed it anyway (proving it couldn't be x64 because Windows won't install 64 bit drivers unsigned. I can give some screenshots proving this.

You can read about this at Wikipedia:Non-free content in the sections on """"text"""". See also Help:Referencing for beginners, for how to cite sources here.
Aside from limited quotation, you must put all information in your own words and structure, in proper paraphrase.

""""I understand the Fez Whatley is a character on a radio show, but your comments made it sound like they had introduced Jonah as Todd's son.""""

No, I specifically didn't say that, because that wouldn't be a direct quote. Listen to the show, and you will hear what I'm referring to. For him to make the statement you're looking for, he'd have to come entirely out of character which, even upon a heart attack, did not happen.

""""Don't insult my intelligence and act like I think Batman is real.""""

Looking back,I would have replied in the same way. Your spoke as if the character was an actual person, whether you actually believe that or not.

""""Even though Todd plays Fez on the radio, any article mentioning Jonah's father would probably say that he hosts a radio show.""""

I see precious little about his father at all, and made sure to look for some that would counter what was said on air before making any changes. Like I said before, if there was no information at all, I doubt I'd have changed anything. It was the information I saw that conflicted with what was said that I thought needed correction.

""""What was said on the show that made you be so confident that Todd was Jonah's father that you ran to Wikipedia to make sure it was on here?""""

Again, since you seemed to have missed it above, I didn't """"run"""" here to add the information. I only ran across this page in searching for what else Jonah had been in. The """"software"""" comment was what I found odd. The discussion between Ron and Fez, mostly at Ron Bennington's prodding, is full of references and allusions to Todd being his father. Since you listened to the show yourself, you should know exactly what I'm speaking of. The fact you don't even acknowledge this, has me wondering about your motives.

The only reasons I can think of for anyone to rebut what I've said, considering that I'm only relating what was said, is that Jonah's family prefer this not to be public, which I'd respect, or that people are just trying to support the character of Fez as a person.

I've no clue what the reason is, but it's really not worth my time to keep reverting the page.  """,0

 Jesus article too long 

Recently, I was trying to add quotes of Jesus to the article but I got a revert with this response:  """"this article is long enough - refer reader to wikisource or other articles"""" Doc glasgow

The problem with this is that many if not all wiki articles on people have quotes of them, and many of them have """"quotes"""" sections.

If the article is too long and you want me to refer to other articles to shorten it up, then I propose we do just that and take some sections away and add a """"Other topics about Jesus"""" towards the bottom that adds the main articles of items we got rid of.

I propose that we condense these topics:

1. Chronology (which is under life and teachings, and we could include a reference to this article's main article in an introduction to the whole Life and Teachings section)
2. Background
3. Names and titles
4. Ethnicity and physical characteristics
5. Artistic and dramatic portrayals

And then, since some of this stuff has sources at the bottom, but is now gone, we can get rid of it.

Also, since most of the sections point to reference articles which discus the sub-topic in more detail, we can get rid of many of the other sources.

This should substantially reduce these sections:
1. Notes
2. Sources and further reading
3. See also
4. External links

After this the whole Jesus article will be much shorter.  Then perhaps we can focus on the stuff left over and make it really nice, and maybe Jesus can become a featured article.

 POV  talk section moved 

POV

i've tried to clean things up a bit though someone else will have to remove the vandalistically applied christianity template lest i be reported for """"edit warring"""" by humus.   i've added a link to the christianity and judaism portals in the """"see also"""" section.   these links are more fitting than claiming this is """"part of the series on christianity""""

this article was very heavy on anti-jfj stuff.  a lengthy """"criticism"""" section as well as criticisms inserted into nearly every other section.  the missionaries are """"taught to speak in hebrew"""" (these people already went to hebrew school!) and jfj is known to """"target vulnerable jews"""" (oh really?) and """"most of the funding comes from christians"""" (well did we think it was coming from muslims and religious jews?) and the current leader """"is not jewish"""" (even though his mother, father, all grandparents were apparently jewish)

some of the criticisms' references were just opinion pieces from religious jews who oppose conversion.  most come from biased publications that don't meet wikipedia's reliable sources standards.  including these references is analogous to editing the """"buddhism"""" article to say that """"all buddhists will burn in hell"""" along with a reference to some fire-n-brimstone website.

anyway, if all we're trying to get across is that some, even many, jewish people and groups oppose jfj we don't need to spread it all over the article.  it isn't at all surprising that religious jews don't want other jews to accept jesus  every missionary movement is opposed by someone.

 

Friend, your edits pushed your delusion that J4J is just another Jewish denomination that a bunch of long-bearded Hassidim oppose. You don't seem to comprehend how the group ruffles feathers throughout the whole length and breadth of the Jewish community even among commies and even among a lot of Christians, as it is contrary to the spirit of modern ecumenicism. J4J is as much defined by the hostility to it as anything else. That is the state of play. I think that you can make a case if you feel the wording is not neutral, but you can't water down the unanimous opposition to J4J and call that """"NPOV"""" 

Thanks for the """"friend"""", nice words are always welcome, even though the rest is not.   Please don't accuse me of """"pushing my delusions"""".   Some jewish groups may strongly oppose them, but there's no way to show that """"all"""" """"mainstream"""" jewish groups, including """"secular"""" groups """"strongly"""" oppose them, without taking the liberty of defining who """"all"""" the """"mainstream"""" jewish groups are, and what degree of """"opposition"""" is """"strong"""".  Can you really not see this simple truth?
Beyond that it just isn't appropriate to overwhelm this article with criticism.  I outlined this above already.   Statements like j4j approachs """"vulnerable jews"""" are unabashedly POV  and tautological.  If anyone converts then its clear they were """"vulnerable"""" to conversion,  so if anyone approached converts, then j4j has approaches """"vulnerable jews"""".
It's not in question that all missionary groups are converting someone from some belief system to another, but it is only barely notable that someone opposes this conversion.  Does McDonald's oppose Burger King and try to put them out of business at every turn?  Yes...but who cares?  Do drug smugglers """"strongly oppose"""" DEA agents coming along and busting up their operations?   Yes...but it would be silly to put it in an article.   Everyone has opposition and it just goes without saying.   Still, I wouldn't be """"strongly opposed"""" to his article having a section on opposition, but nearly every corner of this article is littered with criticism that is all essentially the same.
Compare this article to that of any other missionary group.   In the article """"christianity"""" is there a section labeled """"incompatibility with paganism"""" and """"a belief that is incompatible with paganism"""" and """"all pagan groups strongly oppose christianity""""?   Do we see """"incompatibility with catholicism"""" in the protestant article?   I know this analogy is not going to be satisfying, but no analogy is ever complete.
What are the further objections?   Yes, the group may be called """"Jews for Jesus"""" and that offends people, but what would you have them call themselves?   Would """"Jews that are now christians but still consider themselves jewish"""" be better?  They did use Jackie Mason in a pamphlet.   They also used Steve Jobs and Curious George, and a whole bunch of others, but i don't see Steve Jobs supporters here furious about Jews for jesus """"deceiving"""" ipod owners into believing in jesus.

Handle in text:  It is not clear exactly what the alternative  to this RFC proposal is, or what a """"no"""" or """"yes"""" might yield,  so I will spell out what I see here as the best solution. I agree with Gamaliel and Nomoskedasticity that this is a BLP issue and that using """"Filipino"""" alone is utterly unacceptable and POV.   I do think """"Filipino-American"""" correctly describes the subject of the article, and is not an indication of citizenship, but rather it is a demographic description which could accurately be used.  However,  per TheRedPenOfDoom, and MarkBernstein, I think that this may be best handled as Bbb23 and Seb suggested - and how the lead is now worded - which is to not use either identifier in the first sentence, but instead unpack it, spell out in more detail the actual facts in an NPOV manner, in the lead and in the rest of the article which the intro summarizes.  This works and does not take sides in the serious BLP issue.  We further make clear how Vargas self-identifies, which I think is important here, without having Wikipedia editors take a position. As MarkBernstein said, we are not required to indicate nationality or citizenship in the first sentence or anywhere, and TRPoD is right about disclaimers etc.  -sometimes it is best to go at it from a different angle. We also had the same kind of issue at - believe it or not - Bee Gees where there were warring factions who disagreed about whether they should be called English, Australian, or Manx; we handled it by leaving off the nationality, and the wars stopped.   So, I support this wording: Jose Antonio Vargas (born February 3, 1981) is a journalist, filmmaker, and immigration activist.

"I appreciate you taking the time to have a look at the edit history. Yes Codf1977 was always very active whilst 'semi-retired, but although they made a couple of edits after their 'retirement' their activity had fallen off almost completely (predictably one of their very few 'retirement' edits was to revert an action that I had made here: []) and on quite a few days there was no activity at all on the account. 

 VHarris44 was clearly not someone completely new to Wikipedia. That much is very clear from their skill in navigating Wikipedia, such as posting a help request on their talk page and posting Advert tags on articles, right from the first day of their activity. This is someone who had prior experience on Wikipedia. It is also I believe reasonably well established that VHarris44's behaviour towards me was inappropriate, they were afterall permanently blocked for their behaviour and four requests by them for a reversal were turned down. There is also the issue of VHarris44 having known details about my university. Did they really find this from looking through the history of my talk page? That has to be extremely unlikely. 

 So the obvious question is, who is VHarris44? A very logical possibility is, another experienced user that I have serious disagreements with. To my knowledge there is only one user in that category. Now in view of the timing of that user's retirement, the fact that that retirement quickly followed their failure to succeed in getting a page that I had created deleted, the fact that one of the only edits during their retirement was to undo one of my edits, and the fact that they then remerged so quickly following my difficulties with VHarris44, this is all very strong circumstantial evidence that VHarris44 and Codf1977 are the same person.  So was Codf1977's detailed exposition of their view of my dealings with VHarris44 here: User talk:TFOWR#Rangoon11's filing of Wikipedia:Sockpuppet investigations/Codf1977 and his other actions yesterday.

 In terms of the spelling mistakes made by VHarris44, I have looked again myself and concede that I cannot immediately find examples of the same spelling mistake in Codf1977's writing, but equally I cannot find exactly the same text written by Codf1977 in which those mistakes occurred (i.e. I can't find an example of Codf1977 saying 'no one agrees with you' or 'know one agrees with you'). They both seem to have poor spelling. 'such big changes must be agreed in talk page' is an edit description which both Codf1977 and VHarris44 have used. Ultimately there is little text written by VHarris44 to go on though. 

 I do not believe it a absolute certainly that Codf1977 and VHarris44 are the same person, merely that the circumstantial evidence in that direction is very strong. I can accept that others do not feel the evidence sufficient. However I have been blocked on the grounds of harrassment for making a complaint based upon that circumstantial evidence. That seems very unfair, for even though others may not believe that there is sufficient evidence that Codf1977 and VHarris44 are the same person, I really struggle to see that others cannot see the circumstantial evidence that I saw and therefore relate to why I felt compelled to post a message on the admin board.",0

 The Dellums mayoral campaign was criticized for holding expensive fundraising dinners and because Dellums would not disclose his plans for the city, or his positions on issues.  - please provide a reference for this; surely, per WP:BLP, you would never insert something like this without a source?

 Elise Ackerman, an Oakland resident who bought the domain recallmayordellums.com sent an open letter to Dellums that was covered in the local press, saying to Dellums, """"African Americans and Latinos live in fear in Oakland because of your lies. Middle-class residents working two jobs live in fear because of your lies. Nurses, teachers and social workers live in fear because of your lies."""" Near the end of the message, she continues """"You are not effective, you are not honest, you have no integrity and you should step aside."""" - what is your source for this?

 In 1972 John Lennon wrote the song Woman is the Nigger of the World. Asked for his reaction to the use of the word """"nigger"""" by a white singer in a pop song Dellums wrote """"If you define nigger as someone whose lifestyle is defined by others, whose opportunities are defined by others, whose role in society is defined by others, then good news - you don't have to be black to be a nigger in this society, most of the people in America are niggers!""""

 Your revert 

Hello.

I would like to kindly request reconsideration of your revert (see link above). I had reinstated an edit removed based on a misunderstanding of a previous editor. The other IP user had replaced somebody else's comment with his own, and, when I attempted to take care of it, somebody had already reverted the edit, resulting in the old comment being restored and the new comment, which the IP editor posted (and removed the other comment in the process) being removed. Please browse the diffs starting from here. In my opinion, the edit was made in good faith. I restored the comment. The editor appeared to be legitimately inquiring about a deletion or revert. I reposted and signed it. I had noticed that you have reverted my edit. Please note that I have not at all made my edit in bad faith, and that I have never made bad faith edits to Wikipedia. I have been editing since 2008, had an account, but do not use it anymore since I am quite retired. I had a clean record and had never been blocked from editing. I do not know if it is possible to have those entries removed from the block log, since blocks count against an editor's reputation and I have not made any bad faith edits.

There is for example a dispute about the validity of self-reported results in the general evidence base for CBT which has gained momentum in the last five years.

At the moment you are giving prominence to a one country study in a controversial area that is itself 8 years old.

Kewl. I've read the application section through and can't find what the tone problem is. I've added an intext source note but even as the matter stood the section began """"according to Gurdjieff"""" and so far as I can see doesn't deviate from that attitude or tone. Where does it? Can you quote something objectionable? The section simply explicates the concept.

This is a very simple non-issue. Bagramyan enlisted into the DRA army and fought within its ranks in very crucial (and famous to Armenians) battles against the invading Turks. When you join an army, you are going to fight by its side which Bagramyan did, especially during that time when the Turks were a few km away from Yerevan. The battles (especially Sardarabad) were battles that would determine life or death of the newly established republic. What he joined, became or did after or during the fall of the DRA has nothing to do with what he did prior to it. The DRA's """"brief experience of independence"""" does not disqualify Bagramyan's service to the country and to its survival.

"User:Scarfaced Charley 

I don't know if you remember Wikipedia:Contributor copyright investigations/Scarfaced Charley from over a year ago – I see he was also blocked as a Sockpuppet. I worked a bit on helping fix some of those.  Yesterday I found that Scarfaced Charley had made a duplicate Campaignbox template and therefore some relevant articles were using that Template:Campaignbox Little Rock while others were using the preexisting Template:Campaignbox Advance on Little Rock which follows the WP:MILHIST convention of naming campaignboxes in accordance with the campaigns defined by the American Battlefield Protection Program unit of the National Park Service. That site is currently unavailable because of the Government Shutdown, but can be verified in Google's cache.

I merged the content into Template:Campaignbox Advance on Little Rock, updated all the articles to use the correct campaignbox template, blanked the duplicate template and tagged it with db-t3. I had originally also put a redirect to the corrected template, but I couldn't figure out how to make both the redirect and the db-3 tag work... Hopefully I've done it correctly. Does this situation indeed qualify for speedy deletion or does it need to be brought to TfD?

Except the video I haven't seen anyone naming him as Mohammed Afroz except the video of IndiaToday earlier tagged there and as far as I remember the Delhi police never revealed his name. So I am highly doubtful. Despite whatever his name is, WP:BLPNAME prevents from naming someone whose name has been intentionally omitted officially including in court records and isn't allowed to be named publicly. In the case of a rape victim, the family can reveal the name and the family of Nirbhaya did. However the juvenile isn't allowed ti be named under Juvenile Justice Act. Additionally the victimisation and probable threat on his life if his name is revealed also makes another case why his name shouldn't be there whether the name the sources gave might be wrong or true. Therefore, I am in agreement the previous edit versions containing all the various versions of his real name like Sunil and Mohammed Afroz should be deleted.   04:06, 8",0

I don't have a cite for the """"nice class"""" concept.

"Suspected Sockpuppeteer Turns Out to Be a Human
Shocking news break.  It turns out that the person who originally supplied the information in ISM is me!  A real 

person.... not a 'sock puppeteer.'  There are no socks and no puppets.  Just a real person who thought that a 

business was significant enough to warrant a pace on Wikipedia.  Someone who actually understands the business he is 

in, unlike the editors, who have no experience in the field whatsoever.

It turns out- or so we can surmise, that there are lots of people who want to learn about this company.  Oh no!  

This can't be!  It's a business... not an encyclopedic fact!  

But an encyclopedia like Wikipedia should include everything in the world.  otherwise, why does it exist?  

Encyclopedia Britannica and the Oxford Encyclopedia are perfectly sufficient.

Geekish editors have said that listing this company is 'blatant advertising.'  Yet other advertising companies, like 

Modernista, BBDO, DDB, Ogilvy, etc. are all here... blatant advertising.  So, how big does a company have to be to 

be listed on Wiki?  The answer- there is no answer.  It's all up to the whims of people who have no knowledge nor 

experience in business, who call themselves Carbuncle, Smeff, Dongfart, and the rest.  This is surely detrimental to 

the Wiki.

Why do people have such a Pyongyang attitude towards this?  The very idea of limiting what is shown here- censoring 

pure facts arbitrarily- is against the very idea of a global Wiki.  The great big idea is that this site is 

developed by the people of the world, and includes all the things that the published encyclopedias, which have been 

around for hundreds of years, do not or cannot include.

To my mind, and all the other sane, normal people of the world, this is all ridiculous.  

Please cite the arguments of What Wiki is Not and all the rest.  It is a shortcut to thinking.  And clearly there is 

very little thinking here.  

I have had repeated emails from people around the world asking why they cannot find ISM on Wikipedia, and many from 

people who either wanted to add information on the company or were looking for information for research.  Everyone 

was rebuffed.  What kind of person would do this- what kind of person would sit in their little room, hiding 

information from others, and trying to keep reality away at any cost?  Sock Puppets?  Suspicious users?  Legal 

threats?  What kind of cowardly fool says these things without simply engaging in a dialogue with the person who 

originally wrote the article and who always- ALWAYS - asked for editor input and support?

Go on- look at the history.  You will see that editor input was always taken at first, despite the fact that all 

editors here are wholly unqualified to make a decision on this subject.  When asked to explain themselves, no one 

had the nous to do so.  Delicious Carbuncle, BlueBoy, Todd1, Fisher Queen, etc.   All refused to answer for their 

actions.  Cowards and buffoons who have no sense, courage, nor intelligence. 

Anyone who makes an attack on another person, as these 'editors' have, and runs away without facing the person they 

have attacked, is  not deserving of their powers.  

I am now convinced that Wikipedia, despite it's noble origins, is just a place for fools to feel power in a world 

where they are unable to have any in reality.  Go ahead and add your ridiculous little code to me and my site.  You 

have no argument and have no intelligence- if you think you do, face me like a real human- talk, discuss, and the 

rest.  Or be a true Wiki editor and make a stupid, sarcastic comment and run away... hiding... and never respond to 

your comments.

'Oppose Removal After reading the above comments and looking at some of the users pages it becomes apparent that that deletion is an attempt to silence the oppossition and promote a POV. As an American historian I see that there is strong support for gun ownership rights and has there been for centuries. Many Americans see this as a valid argument against gun control and in America it is not a fringe theory. The article is about Gun Control and one could infer American Gun control because it is no longer an issue in most other countries. The argument has legs and to deny that is to deny history for political motivations. Whether or not we agree with the argument is irrelevant. History is not about voting on current policies. The proper thing to due is to have arguments for and against the viewpoint and not to bury it because like a zombie it will rise again.

"""==Removal of seal==
The University seal was removed from this page.  Per the University's official logo guidelines, available at http://logo.wustl.edu, the seal is limited to items for Commencement and those events sponsored by the Board of Trustees, the Chancellor, or the deans and requires special permission from the University for use.

Please be advised that the University has in the past pursued legal action when images and symbols are used without permission for which permission is specifically required.
This unsigned comment was added by  (talk • contribs) .

First, I must kindly ask the user who posted this topic to please sign their username to their post in future. Secondly, the use of Washington University’s seal in a Wikipedia article is perfectly fair and legal. Just as wikipedia is allowed to use the logo’s of McDonalds , Apple, and other US corporations that have also copyrighted their logo’s, a wikipedia article is still allowed to use College and University seals under the US copyright law’s fair use'' policy. Wikipedia does not need permission to use Washington University’s seal so long as it meets the fair use qualifications. Every other university's seal including  Harvard's, Northwestern's,  and Yale's is used in Wikipedia articles that reference them, even though they have similar policies about university seal use. This because wikipedia is a non-profit foundation, allowed to use copyrighted logo’s under the fair use policy.  

I will be reinstating Washington University's Seal to meet the format consistent with other US College and university articles. 

Please be advised that legal counsel has been notified.  The University makes available the official University logo for these purposes.  Use of the University seal is strictly prohibited and protected.  

The use of the Washington University seal even if it is copyrighted is allowed on Wikipedia through the fair use policy. Notify legal consul if you must but the Fair use policy has already been affirmed in court see: Kelly v. Arriba Soft Corporation. I have also examined user 's discussion page and found that the user has flouted Wikipedia rules and regulations in the past. Taking this into account I will continue to reinstate the university seal until the user   presents a concrete reason why I should not. Placing the university seal on the wikipedia article that it concerns is consistent with wikipedia format, and encouraged by the wikipedia community. The same policy which governs the use of Washington University logo also governs the Washington University seal. And I question  to be a spokesperson for the university and decide that it is acceptable to use the logo. Although I was unable to access the link that
  provided in an attempt to present their case my understanding is that the policy applies to the use of the seal by members of the university community and not an outside non for profit foundation. Once again there has been no violation of the fair use policy concerning the Washington University seal brought to my attention and 
87
Atherefore I continue reverting to the original article until one such violation is identified. 

user  please post Washington University seal policy in full on the talk page so users can examine it and compare it to other university policies as I said before I was unable to access the link, you still not be removing the seal PLEASE stop. 

I do agree with  that Fair Use doctrine permits use of the seal in such a not-for-profit context. (As a sidenote, Wikipedia's image tag for """"logos,"""" which asserts the right to use such images in this context, surely wasn't invented out of thin air; there's presumably some legal research/knowledge behind that tag's invention.) I think we might do well soliciting the advice of an administrator who has specific experience in copyright/Fair-Use issues, if this dispute continues. Surely this sort of issue must pop up on Wikipedia all the time.

 Inclusion of retraction by """"The Hindu"""" 

This article was the subject of a """"Mediation"""" proceeding between 
(a) """"India Against Corruption"""" organisation and (b) Wikipedia """"community"""" represented by User:Sitush at . 

The core issues were:
(a) Whether the appellations """"Team Anna"""" and """"India Against Corruption"""" unambiguously refer to the same entity or not
 (b) Whether defamatory / disparaging statements emanating from misuse of the India Against Corruption's title(s) by third parties should be associated with the actual India Against Corruption movement in Wikipedia's article(s), or if these should be taken to articles on Anna Hazare, Team Anna, Jantantra Morcha etc. ?

Midway through the mediation, Sitush dropped out when he couldn't justify his edits. These content issues accordingly stand automatically decided in IAC's favour. 

Despite the decision, the article content is unchanged and the defamatory/disparaging statement remain. On 27.March.2014 the venerable newspaper """"The Hindu"""" published a retraction (by means of a clarification) of their story implying that Genl. V.K.Singh and Mr. Anna Hazare were a part of India Against Corruption.

Accordingly, the issues for discussion are proposed as follows:

A) Is the published retraction by """"The Hindu"""" worthy of prominent inclusion in this article with the following text, or suchlike

Public Notice

Sarbajit Roy National Convenor of India Against Corruption has issued public notices and clarified """"that persons like Gen (Retd.) V.K.Singh were never associated with India Against Corruption and neither was Mr. Anna Hazare a part of it. Referring to them in the context of IAC is misleading especially in context of political activity"""".

B) Should the above information also be prominently included in the article LEDE so that casual internet readers are not confused.

C) Should all content about """"Team Anna"""" be deleted or taken back to the """"Team Anna"""" article which was unilaterally merged here on 25 Nov. 2013 without notice or discussion.   """,0

Parts of my own Talk Page deleted by editors who think they know better

Dear impartial but not disinteresed reader, Coren and I have been having an entertaining and enjoyable """"discussion"""" on the finer points of """"soapboxing"""".  She is of the firm, resolute belief that this version of my own talk page amounts to """"soapboxing"""" and has deleted it.  I recognize that there may be elements of soapboxing in the """"investment predictions for 2008"""" section at the bottom of the page, but have given her the opportunity to amend rather than delete the whole section.  She has declined the opportunity to amend, leaving me in the difficult position of having to type this with a knife pressed ever-so-gently against my back, with Coren carefully looking over my shoulder at the screen to check whether anything is, in her God-like view, """"soap-like"""".  Not the most pleasant position to be in, I can assure you.

To use another example, picked completely at random: Let's say there's been a nasty and vicious and ugly and persistent edit war over, say, fractional reserve banking, and a number of editors want a messy but more informative version like this one kept in.  Then let's say I post this earlier version on my talk page for readers to compare with the now in-my-humble-view slaughtered version.  Is that """"soapboxing""""??

To use another example, closer to home.  Let's say a guy like Zenwhat says to his co-conspirators, """"What can we do to have OUR version of debt-based monetary system/fractional reserve banking prevail?"""", like he clearly said here under the (desperate?) heading """"Heeeeelp"""".  

And then he also (bizarrely?) asks Gregalton help him delete references to Mises.org like he did here, saying to Gregalton: """"Also, in case you're interested, one of the easiest ways to find economics articles that have been vandalized is to do a search for links to Mises.org""""

As if a reference to the great Ludwig von Mises amounted to VANDALISM? Can you BELIEVE IT?  I have to hold a pencil between my teeth just to keep control of myself and keep typing this.  The guy is clearly a vicious tiny weeny little troll.  

He also says to his co-conspirator the following, on the same page: 

""""I looked at the fractional reserve banking article recently and saw how it was so horribly vandalized. It made me realize that we're going around in circles. We improve the articles to the point that they look great. Then they get screwed up again. So, I had an idea: Would you be interested in helping me write an essay on """"Monetary Crankery""""? It could help people who AREN'T educated...The idea is for it to be straightforward, with references, but polemic and satirical of monetary crankery.""""

Clearly this guy is obsessed with deleting or """"satirizing"""" any positions on monetary theory that don't agree with his.  (The guy is mad.  If the guy had napalm or nukes he'd use them without hesitation.)   

Then, for good measure, he goes back to debt-based monetary system to do more """"editing"""".  

Zenwhat is clearly a piece of work.  Check out the dude's talk page.  In addition to his obsessive interest in deleting anything associated with Mises.org, his main interests appear to be something called """"cannabis culture"""" and """"the Buddhist connection with marijuana"""".  So, I gather from this that his main """"interests"""" are monetary theory and dope smoking.  What a combo!

Seeing this, I ponder my options.  I decide to post a note here, ON MY OWN TALK PAGE, asking readers to compare older (better?) versions of some important articles on monetary theory with the current versions.  For good measure I offer my predictions on the financial markets for 2008 as a gift to the (eight?) people persistent enough to read my humble little talk page.  

It immediately gets deleted by all-seeing, all-knowing Coren as """"soapboxing"""".  Is this strict compliance with WP guidelines or a WP-style Fascist Dictatorship where people like Coren delete at will, but don't bother to make CONSTRUCTIVE suggestions as to how what I have written CAN come within the guidelines?    

This is like watching evolution in reverse.  I carefully construct a page with the help of others.

 Taking this to your own talk page as you don't seem quite as keen on listening to what I've got to say over on my page as you are hellbent on defiling everyone's edits for your enjoyment 

Alright, I've just had it up to here with you and your blasphemous claims of everyone's edits being """"unreferenced crap"""" because you're the only one who can't remain content of having others contribute to the site. I can put up with your labels of every edit you find disastisfactory to your bigoted tastes as """"vandalism,"""" but going through everyone's freaking contributions list to make it some White Man's Burden to undo every small trimmings of blatantly incorrect or dingy information is just pushing the line, so I suggest you don't break the 3-edit rule yourself if you're so pompously insisting the rules and law enforcements here are on your side.

Let's see back where this started in the Freeza section, for example. Like I said on my edits page, I haven't familiarized myself with making those neat little references at the bottom to add to my edits, so in straight, bold text as clear as day, I posted the chapter number where the psychic ability itself was displayed, and could well post an image to back up my claims, while each and every one of the rest of the information I posted was seen throughout his extended fight sequences with Goku and co., you can bet your money on it; it's not Berserk or Blade of the Immortal we're talking about here, but plain-out, simple everyday Dragonball, which everyone (save you) would be fully capable of seeing. 

Then, the Vegeta article? Please, Vegeta himself professed about the 17 million zenos required to initiate his Ozaru transformation which can only be produced by a full moon or his power ball that mixes with the planet's oxygen to create a replacement, which both he and Gohan used to transform, and after his tail was sliced off by Yajirobe, he fled to the Freeza Planet and stated that his tail would grow back after he came out of the healing tank with the tail stump in plain view. None of this is uncited information by any means, and you're well striking a chord with everyone's anger by hellbenting on removing all that on the crappy pretense that because you can't deal with someone else making contributions, you're right in labeling them """"unreferenced crap"""" or """"vandal"""" and digging through everyone's records like a 40-year old wanker to annul every effort.

And again, the Piccolo article? I simply added that Nail was the one he first fused with to gain his """"massive increase"""" and that he was the one who kicked Freeza away to help buy time for Goku's Genki Dama to charge, and I myself removed some so-called """"crap"""" information like """"Piccolo's bukujutsu being a different technique"""" when the Japanese manga simply states that his technique is a superior kind. What little others there were (my contributions, I mean) are simple, medial additions like """"scientist Gero"""" added to the unclear information that simply said """"Red Ribbon"""" at first, when it was just the one guy and nobody else that was working for vengeance. 

And finally, I've been on this site since back in 2005 or 6 or so since I was 14 and fully know my rules and qualifications, and haven't been blocked once, so I'd suggest that you take it to my profile if you've got such a beef with my edits that you need to act like a petulant, 4-year old child who wants his toy back destroying everyone's contributions on your whim when you yourself are no authority. 

Thanks for your time.""",0

Potential and kinetic are a very general classification of energy forms. As stated in the present version of the article, these are mostly useful in mechanics. Based on the fact that a photon has no mass, the equations that are given in the present definition of kinetic energy are not applicable to electromagnetic radiation. I must say I agree with Andries. Also, this article is part of an encyclopedia. Why should it be limited  to the basic definitions of kinetic and potential energy forms and I see no reason why we are trying to associate energy forms as to being only potential or kinetic. I like the work done by Bensaccount, but I think it needs to be elaborated. Electrical energy, for example, has both forms of potential and kinetic energies. According to """"Principles of science"""", 1966, the most common forms of energy are mechanical energy, chemical energy, heat energy, sound energy (compressional waves), light energy (electromagnetic radiation), electrical energy and nuclear energy. I think if someone would like to expand on these it would be benificial to everyone.

 The reasons I dont contribute to Wikipedia anymore 
Reversions like the one you just executed on the psychology template presuppose a knowledge of psychology.  I must imagine that if you don't understand why the template is inadequate then you have not the faintest idea of what constitutes pscyhology. It is a) an academic (taught) discipline, b) a research discipline, c) an applied discipline, d) a profession, interest group and lobby e) a property of of social perception or a folk psychology if you like and f) an aspect of the humanities and the social sciences as well as a peer of psychiatry, social work and in some respects occupational therapy; g) a contested political terrain (which you would understand if a non-amateur had written the articles on critical psychology and cultural-historical psychology). Neither the template nor the main article bring out these distinctions. Instead what you have is a bad summary of a first year textbook of an American perspective on the psychodynamic-post- Skinnerian model of psychology circa 1950s. Having to explain this and to persuade you is hardly what someone with advanced expertise in the area wants to be doing on a Saturday afternoon. It is insulting, demoralizing and a waste of time. I imagine that the net sum of your expertise can probably be located at the lower end of a) or e) in which case you are probably enthuisiastic about your ignorance. So thank you for giving me one more reason not to contribute to wikipedia.

 Supposed influence on historical events 

I am entirely new to editing so I hope someone can guide me on this matter. The claim """"The meetings would have a great influence on the shaping of the modern country of Canada as well as on the Pacific Northwest of the United States"""" appears in the beginning with a now invalid citation link, which isn't terribly surprising given it was listed in 2006. The issue is the cited material does not back the quoted claim in any fashion and nor does any historical narrative I have read. The diplomatic wrangling between the Americans and British for a few decades was over the Columbia River as a border (or not). Eventually the British agreed to an American proposal for the continuation of the border along 49th the parallel.

Where does the PGO fit into this? It stated the 54'40 was the northern border despite having no control over any land north of the Columbia River. In 1845 an agreement with the local Hudson's Bay Company was established, with the company """"joining"""" the government. Theoretical control was extended by the PGO, but the majority of the offices for the northern districts were held by the British. I don't see this event holding """"great influence"""" over both Canada and the United States. About the only matter that the PGO was to create that influenced (only America) was the Cayuse War.

So what should be done about this exactly? The claim is simply far too bold to be considered historically accurate. In the meantime I updated the link, but it is worth repeating it doesn't validate the claim.   """,0

It is historically documented that Bosnian Church was the state religion before the crusaders and before the arrival of franciscans and that this religion was the religon of the bosniak people (then called bosnjanins). However some were forced to convert to catholicism and some were so brainwashed that they accepted catholicism. Thoose who bravely kept their religion to the arrival of turks directly accepted Islam while those catholics who accepted Islam were simply Bosnian bogumils who earlier had converted to catholicism. Since Bosnia was and still is kind of isolated then there were no strong religion and people could change religion every week. That is why many Bosnians accepted Islam.,0

"MSU Interview

Dear Samir,

My name is Jonathan Obar user:Jaobar, I'm a professor in the College of Communication Arts and Sciences at Michigan State University and a Teaching Fellow with the Wikimedia Foundation's Education Program. This semester I've been running a little experiment at MSU, a class where we teach students about becoming Wikipedia administrators. Not a lot is known about your community,  and our students (who are fascinated by wiki-culture by the way!) want to learn how you do what you do, and why you do it. A while back I proposed this idea (the class) to the community HERE, where it was met mainly with positive feedback. Anyhow, I'd like my students to speak with a few administrators to get a sense of admin experiences, training, motivations, likes, dislikes, etc. We were wondering if you'd be interested in speaking with one of our students.

So a few things about the interviews:
 Interviews will last between 15 and 30 minutes.
 Interviews can be conducted over skype (preferred), IRC or email. (You choose the form of communication based upon your comfort level, time, etc.)
 All interviews will be completely anonymous, meaning that you (real name and/or pseudonym) will never be identified in any of our materials, unless you give the interviewer permission to do so.
 All interviews will be completely voluntary. You are under no obligation to say yes to an interview, and can say no and stop or leave the interview at any time.
 The entire interview process is being overseen by MSU's institutional review board (ethics review). This means that all questions have been approved by the university and all students have been trained how to conduct interviews ethically and properly.

Bottom line is that we really need your help, and would really appreciate the opportunity to speak with you. If interested, please send me an email at obar@msu.edu (to maintain anonymity) and I will add your name to my offline contact list. If you feel comfortable doing so, you can post your name  instead.

If you have questions or concerns at any time, feel free to email me at obar@msu.edu. I will be more than happy to speak with you.

Thanks in advance for your help. We have a lot to learn from you.

Sincerely,

Jonathan Obar

"Frivolous tempering with data by User:Antidote
User:Antidote evidently thinks that I am a moron or may be he himself is a moron but I'll let you judge for yourselves:

User:Antidote keeps quoting NationMaster, which represents an idiotic compilation of facts from Wikipedia (edition several months ago) and other sources, including the Factbook. If one opens Demographics of Bulgaria in NationMaster, one will see the wikipedia article 70 days exactly at the pointn when it was subject to vandalism by an anonomous user who frivolously (ha! it is not only Antidote who does such things but may be Antidote and anonymous are the same person???) tampered with the data from Census 2001. Thank you, thank you, thank you very much, Antidote for providing us with this extremely precious information. (Applause waited)

User:Antidote takes an estimate of the Factbook and calculates on his own ethnic distributions using the 2001 census up to the hundreds!!! How wise that is, my dear, I am thrilled!!! Has the thought that YOU MAY NOT DO OWN CALCULATIONS crossed your mind? Have you thought that ethnic distributions in 2001 may not be valid in 2005? What if the number of Bulgarians suddenly exploded? Or that it suddenly plunged? Ha???

So, the estimate of the Factbook... Some organisation based in Washington makes an estimation without giving any ground for its estimations, without being a statistics organization but User:Antidote thinks this is the best source he could take a 2005 estimate from. Well, the Factbook may be well-publiced but Brittney Spears is well-publicised, as well, and her music is shite. Look at these two links, the first one is the official estimate of Eurostat for 2005  (7,761,000), the other one is an encyclopedia quoting the official estimate of the UN for 2003  (7,897,000). These are REPUTABLE STATISTICS ORGANISATIONS and compared with them, the Factbook is worthless. Other questions, my dear?

"Another common theme of the financial 'media' is to claim that Japan is a source of liquidity to the world.  Low interest rates actually reduce liquidity as interest payments are not being made on loans, and thus, money isn't available for financial intermediaries to recycle back into making new loans.  The money supply in Japan has been steadily declining for at least the past few years, yet world stock markets have been reaching new highs, and assets of all kinds have been bid to sky-high valuations.  Thus, it can be argued that the asset bubble is being driven by money supply expansion in Europe and the United States, and not by the shrinking money supply in Japan.

The bottom line is that I don't feel this will have a happy ending for the United States.  The dollar has dropped 5.5% in the past week, which, for the world's largest economy, is pretty much on the threshold of a currency crisis.",0

Alan, I'm not sure what you think is compromised ... could you clarify? The core issue we are discussing relates to the template/contents of an Integral portal page that actually reflects the integral movement as it exists. AQAL is one author's (Ken Wilber's) name for his particular developmental model. It is already described in the wikipedia's Ken Wilber article and nobody has suggested that a separate page be added for it. The issue is whether thinkers who call themselves integral and are generally understood and acknowledged as """"integral thinkers"""", doing work that is called """"Integral Studies"""", can simply be identified in the Integral portal page as such, no matter what their particular sect or affinity, (which is all that I have suggested), or whether such thinkers need to be divided a priori into pro-Ken Wilber and anti-Ken Wilber camps, or """"Integral (AQAL)"""" and """"Integral"""", as it seems you may now be proposing. Obviously term AQAL (or even Wilberian for that matter) can be used inoccuously to describe Wilber's own writings. But how does a wikipedia editor decide that a work that calls itself integral (not AQAL) is not suitable for an integral portal page but only an AQAL portal? Even I did so once, as you noted. But it is quite another for a wikipedia editor to declare that certain thinkers or books cannot be linked or acknowledged at an integral portal but only an AQAL portal, based on some subjective interpretation of their use of elements of AQAL theories. I still do not see an answer for whether you would allow Robert Kegan into the integral portal or whether you would insist that he be listed under AQAL only, and I could ask the same question about dozens of writers who cite Wilber as one of many influences. Without a principled and objective answer, I think you are asking wikipedia editors to step into a totally untenable position. As I wrote earlier:
...usually thinkers use some aspect of Wilber's thought combined with the thought of many other sources, seldom use every feature of AQAL, and often disagree about key points. On what basis do you insist that people who call their thought integral actually be considered Wilberian? How much of Wilber's thought must one agree with to be so classified, and who decides? When you acknowledge that a thinker such as Robert Kegan has """"mutually influenced"""" Wilber and yet is part of the integral school of thought, would you propose to create a new Integral portal for such hard-to-classify thinkers, and segregate every thinker that displays too much affinity to Wilber or his model into a separate category, either explicitly called """"Integral theory (Wilberian)"""" or """"Integral theory"""" (but with the Wilberian association implicit, with a wikipedia editor such as yourself presumably determining whether every new thinker is sufficiently anti-Wilber to be listed in the main category)? 
I have not proposed that AQAL be used as a synonym for integral at all, only that any thinker who describes their work as integral and is generally acknowledged as such by independent sources be listed or linked at the integral portal in an appropriate fashion. Since, perhaps, some 90% of thinkers describing themselves as integral today are influenced to one degree or another by Wilber, the consequence of using the term integral in a neutral, objective way as I have proposed may very well be that many themes and ideas treated at the integral portal will be connected to AQAL in some fashion. Again, I will say that in my opinion the right place for your concern about AQAL being inappropriately used as a synonym for integral is in reviewing the content of the pages rather than in denying the usefulness of an integral portal at all.

 TIBIN VARGHESE (CREATED BY) Hypertension  

Hypertension
 
Hypertension is a disorder characterized by consistently high blood pressure. Generally, high blood pressure consists of systolic blood pressure (the """"top"""" number, which represents the pressure generated when the heart beats) higher than 140, or diastolic blood pressure (the """"bottom"""" number, which represents the pressure in the vessels when the heart is at rest) over 90.

Effect on the Eyes
High blood pressure can injure the eyes, causing a condition called retinopathy
Hypertensive retinopathy
 
Damage to the retina from high blood pressure is called hypertensive retinopathy. It occurs as the existing high blood pressure changes the microvasculature of the retina. Some of the first findings in the disease are flame hemorrhages and cotton wool spots. As hypertensive retinopathy progresses, hard exudates can appear around the macula along with swelling of the macula and the optic nerve, causing impairment of vision. In severe cases permanent damage to the optic nerve or macula can occur.
Bone Loss
Hypertension also increases the elimination of calcium in urine, potentially leading to loss of bone mineral density, a significant risk factor for fractures, particularly in elderly women. In one study, women with the highest levels of blood pressure lost bone density at nearly twice the rate of those in the lowest range. It is not clear whether this effect occurs in men or in non-Caucasian women.

Sexual Dysfunction
Sexual dysfunction is more common and more severe in men with hypertension and in smokers than it is in the general population. Many of the drugs that treat hypertension are thought to cause impotence as a side effect. In these cases, it is reversible when the drugs are stopped. More recent evidence suggests, however, that the disease process that causes hypertension is itself the major cause of erectile dysfunction in these men. Newer anti-hypertensive drugs, including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs), are less associated with erectile dysfunction. ARBs, such as losartan (Cozaar), may be particularly effective in restoring erectile function in men with high blood pressure. Sildenafil (Viagra) is successful in achieving erections in almost two-thirds of patients with controlled high blood pressure. Because sildenafil has a shorter half-life and is eliminated more quickly from the body than newer erectile dysfunction drugs, it may be a safer option for men with hypertension. In a 2003 review of safety data, sildenafil did not appear to pose a risk for men who had both high blood pressure and erectile dysfunction.
Pregnancy and Preeclampsia
Severe, sudden high blood pressure in pregnant women is one component of a condition called preeclampsia (commonly called toxemia) that can be very serious for both mother and child. Preeclampsia occurs in up to 10% of all pregnancies, usually in the third trimester of a first pregnancy, and resolves immediately after delivery. Other symptoms and signs of preeclampsia include protein in the urine, severe headaches, and swollen ankles.
This condition may be caused by a failure of the placenta to embed properly in the uterus, which causes it to misconnect with the mother's blood vessels. As a result, the fetus does not receive a sufficient blood supply, and the mother's own blood pressure increases to replace it.

The reduced supply of blood to the placenta can cause low birth weight and eye or brain damage in the fetus. Severe cases of preeclampsia can cause kidney damage, convulsion, and coma in the mother and can be lethal to both mother and child.
Women at risk for preeclampsia (particularly those with existing hypertension) may benefit from having an ultrasound of uterine arteries at 20 to 24 weeks of pregnancy, followed (if abnormal) by 24-hour blood pressure monitoring.
Uterine Fibroids
High blood pressure may increase the risk of developing fibroids, according to data from the Nurses’ Health Study. Tracking women for 10 years, the prospective epidemiologic study found that for every 10 mm/Hg increase in diastolic blood pressure, the risk for developing fibroids increased by 8 - 10%.

Outlook for Children with Hypertension
Children with high blood pressure should first be treated with lifestyle changes, including weight reduction, increased physical activity, and diet modification. If blood pressure is not controlled with lifestyle changes, drug treatment may be required. Although there are few clinical trials conducted in children, a 2005 study found that the angiotensin receptor blocker losartan was safe and effective in children. Results of studies evaluating outcomes of children with hypertension suggest that early abnormalities, including enlarged heart and abnor",0

I am not in a hurry per say, my concern is that, until very recently, there has been no hint of the text being edited, only talks about it being re-written some time int he future, in the mean time, AFD, Proarepa and the Beyloune and Barrueco family are mentioned the biggest encyclopedia on planet hearth in a huge scandal, without them having had had anything to do with it. Just imagine. All news reports agree on where the money came from, who carried it, for whom he was carrying it, who was charged with the crime and who the money was for. None of those persons have anything to do with the companies and persons on list A. Of course the following suggestion is tainted with my stance on this matter, but, perhaps, until the article is re-written, the text in bold could be suppressed, at least temporarily:

""""According to El Nuevo Herald and El Universal, Antonini Wilson owns a condo in Ocean Club, Key Biscayne, Florida; together with Wladimir Abad, he is registered as owner of a building located in Mashta Avenue, in Key Biscayne, valued at $US3.96 million.[22] Wladimir Abad is the secretary of American Food Grain (AFG),[23] a part of a Venezuelan holding called Proarepa, owned by Sarkis Arslanian Beyloune and Ricardo Fernández Barrueco.[22][24] Proarepa was in charge of the food distribution during Venezuela's oil strike of 2002, when Chávez signed contracts for food distribution. According to the Venezuelan Government Press Office, Proarepa is a private company that has """"joined this mission (Mission Mercal) to offer food and better price to the Venezuelan consumer"""".[22] According to El Nuevo Herald, Antonini Wilson's name is linked to other companies in southern Florida, such as Venuz Supply Inc., Intertel Telecom and Techmilk Inc.;[22][25][26] La Nación says that Antonini is among a group of businessmen who benefited economically during the administration of Hugo Chávez.[26] In May of 2007, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) confiscated a jet belonging to American Food Grain. The report, according to The Miami Herald, says Ricardo Fernández Barruecos had not respected federal norms to register the plane in the United States.[22][23][27]""""

Pronunciation:
    \ˈrō-zə-vəlt (Roosevelts' usual pron.), -ˌvelt also ˈrü-\
Dictionary.com gives:
Roo·se·velt  /ˈroʊzəˌvɛlt, -vəlt, ˈroʊzvɛlt, -vəlt; spelling pron. ˈruzəˌvɛlt/
Inogolo gives this about Teddy's name:
Name: Roosevelt  Phonetic Pronunciation: ROAZ-uh-velt
Notes: There has been much debate about the correct pronunciation of Roosevelt's last name, however, in several letters Theodore Roosevelt himself specifies the correct pronunciation. In a letter to the Rev. William W. Moir dated October 10, 1898 he writes:
As for my name, it is pronounced as if it was spelled """"Rosavelt."""" That is in three syllables. The first syllable as if it was """"Rose.""""
Note that none of these sources make a distinction between Teddy and FDR, despite the claims of some that they preferred different pronunciations.  At the very least, each article should be internally consistent.  For Teddy, it seems to be clear that it's /ˈɹoʊzəvɛlt/.  His statement above makes that pretty clear.  FDR's case doesn't seem to be as unequivocal, but the same pronunciation seems to be the preferred one in most media.  The most common variant seems to be the barely noticeably different /ˈɹoʊzəvəlt/.  Most seem to cite the preferred pronunciation of the name being three syllables, not two.

how to fix this article
In some kinds of academic discourse it's considered incorrect to use the term """"racism"""" to describe what are essentially racist actions by an oppressed minority. I understand, and even, in certain contexts agree with this. However, I don't see anything wrong with calling Black supremacy racist when were talking about the kind of Black supremacy that explicitly says that non-black people are inferior.

The problem I have with this article and the article on Black Power is that they both, at times, conflate the legitimate, if reactionary, anti-racist, black empowerment movements with cultish and fringe ideas and groups that have little or no currency in the greater US black community.

A comparison would be if you equated all people who are pro-life with skin heads. I bet there are a lot of pro-life skin heads, and both groups have a lot of white people in them but they don't really have anything to do with each other. (!)

In order to fix this article and the article on black power we need to realize that there are racist fringe groups, and describe them, and their history and motivation fairly.

I have a few questions: 

Is every group listed here a """"self described"""" black supremacy group? Or are some of these groups concerned about """"black power"""" (there is a difference!)

Do we represent the history of these groups and the racial climate they grew out of fairly?""",0

 about your comment on Elaragirl's talk page 

Hello Dev920, I couldn't help but notice your comments on  talk page under the heading """"Esperanza"""", so I'm sorry if you feel this was an intrusion of your privacy (or Elaragirl's). I wanted to remind you that there is a spectrum of individual editors who claim affiliation with Esperanza, and some editors, how shall I say this? contribute less towards the mainspace than others.  As for the governance issue, I personally don't understand the current structure and I don't feel as if they exert any influence on me at any rate.

I still think that an off-Wikipedia coffee lounge that has an obvious link on Esperanza's page is the best way to satisfy those users who like to spend their time in the lounge, and still address the concerns of those who are opposed to its presence on Wikipedia. What's one more click of the mouse? Just so you know, I had participated a little in the coffee lounge, but I got turned off of it because of the random dog barking and a series of dirty jokes which I felt were sexist, offensive, and not at all belonging on Wikipedia. Because I had participated only to a limited extent, my overall edit count (2971 as of ) wasn't seriously affected when the coffee lounge was deleted.

I had proposed a hypothetical merger between Esperanza, the Kindness Campaign, and Concordia, and while I still think that many of their stated goals overlap, I also feel that Esperanza needs to better define itself before even considering such a merger, and feedback must be solicited from members of all three groups. I was unaware that Esperanza had a prior history of attempting mergers in the past. If you feel that my suggestion was naive and arrogant, chalk it up to my own shortsightedness, not to Esperanza as a whole.

I know that we may differ in our views of what to do with Esperanza, but at least the MfD and in particular comments by you, Elaragirl, and others, have given the impetus for Esperanza to examine itself. Thank you for that.

Since I've typed this much, I might as well invite you to review me at editor review. Thanks again for your participation in all of this.  """,0

Hi Rob, my guess would be editors who sympathize with the British position.  Collins is something of a hero to the British and the Protestant right wingers in Ireland (and are remnants of the former Protestant ruling class) since he signed the treaty to end the Irish War of Independence that created the Irish Free State.  Sinn Fein and the IRA, the left wingers and Catholic, were against it and viewed Collins as a traitor.  The Civil War resulted.  The IRA assassinated him.  The treaty allowed the British to still subjugate the Irish.  Lloyd George and Winston Churchill were ecstatic.  Eamon de Valera and Sinn Fein were not.  They wanted a Republic and to be rid of the British entirely.  The British and the Irish Protestants are still big Collins' fans.  Downplaying his Catholicism, in fact virtually eliminating the religious aspects of the conflict, is something the British do.  It's PR.  Malke2010 """,0

MovieFan Contribs
I deleted the edits by User MovieFan because most of them were inaccurate in light of the latest research. For example: Peg Entwsitle was never in """"bit parts"""" or a """"handful of films."""" Extensive research for her biography, which included weeks of reviewing original RKO office memos, contracts, and payroll records concerning Entwistle, support her having a role in just one film.

Moreover, the claim regarding Entwistle's Los Angeles play """"The Mad Hopes"""" in the newspaper item sourced by MovieFan is completely spurious. Contrary to this source, the play, a pre-Broadway tryout, was a rousing success in San Diego and Los Angeles during its several-weeks' run. My research discovered many reviews and theatrical periodicals containg nothing but praise for the play and players. The MovieFan source contained, """"but nothing came of it,"""" in regard to a context insinuating that Peg hadn't got the part. In fact, the premiere of this play at the Belasco was a Red Carpet event on the scale of a Hollywood film premiere!

The contribs by MovieFan with regard the divorce of Entwistle and Robert Keith are only partly accurate, taken from news accounts whereas the official and complete court testimony by Peg Entwistlewhich I have in my posessiondoes not entirely reflect MovieFan's edit. The """"hair pulling"""" account is in fact reflected in the official court document, but does this information actually improve the Wiki?

There is more I can discuss, however, I wish to make it clear that I do not want to discourage MovieFan, or anyone else, from contributing to Peg Entwistle's Wiki. God knows the wars that have been waged in the past regarding it! But I simply found it easier to Undo the MovieFan contribs in their entirety in the hopes that MovieFan, or anyone else, would discuss the content.

Honestly, while I'm very pleased that Peg Entwistle has so many fans, I think her Wiki should be left as is. Using the old sources, such as tabloids and newspapers is a tricky affair with many red herrings. It's best, I believe, to leave the Entwistle page alone.

This page has improved greatly in terms of content. I feel, having read it, that I understand the essential skills of a shooting guard, as well as bonus skills, the way a shooting guard fits into a typical play, etc. Now the page needs some work on grammar and style. This sentence, for instance, is odd:

""""Shooting guards can be known for excelling at certain skills that shooting guards should be able to exhibit.""""

Well, of course. At the very least a player should master the skill set for his or her position, no? If this sentence is meant (as I believe it is, judging from the awkward sentence fragment that immediately follows in the paragraph) to introduce a discussion of players who are particularly known for mastering the shooting guard skill set (as opposed, say, to being all-around good players who just happen to be physically suited for the shooting guard position), then I suggest changing the sentence to say just that: """"Certain shooting guards are particularly known for mastering the shooting guard skill set (as opposed, say to being all-around good players who just happen to be physically suited for the shooting guard position)"""". Then I would begin the next sentence with the words, """"Such shooting guards include . . .""""

Sasha Vujacic....
Should this guy be listed among the rest? I think not. Please remove him from the list.

The list of 2 guards who are known for attacking the rim is laughably inaccurate.  Allan Houston was a pure jump shooter. Ben Gordon never goes all the way to the rim on his drives. He pulls up for floaters and jump shots well before the rim.  McGrady and Carter attacked earlier in their careers, but are now constantly criticized by league analysts for being too passive. They are mostly jump shooters now.  Jason Richardson is a great dunker but I would certainly not put him on this list either. He drives to the rim far less than he shoots.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)

Hey, I wasn't intending to be rude but ironic. Concepts of irony differ between concepts of ironic (most users of British English and Hiberno-English claim that Americans don't do irony - which was why some modern US comedy shows have shocked Europeans by showing that some members do indeed do irony.)

Failed verification
Pressure

A source is being mis-used where there is a statement that says the fringe media pressured these various agencies to respond.   

Entry says:Because of the popularity of the conspiracy theory, official agencies have received many enquiries from people demanding an explanation.[1][3]

I think it is dubious and the source does not mention popularity as the cause for this pressure nor do these vague inquires seem to be specific incident complaints of the type these agencies investigate. This would require times, dates, locations, to proof of an incident much less any """"suspect"""" worthy of investigation by the responding agencies.  One caveat is that these are alleged to be CBW issues and an environmental agency, space agency, or weather agency, or FAA would not even be the primary agency to respond, In my opinion, they might be notified or have something forwarded to them if only to answer questions that they might receive.  After enough questions they made fact sheets.  Were the fact sheets released solely because the theory is popular or because of the exasperating questions?  It should worded better. example below:.  Not sure what the dead link said. It's not verifiable.

This is example consistent with the remaining source:

_______________________

>Hello Beaumont,I noticed that you have recently joined the Dzierzon discussion and especially Dzierzon's self-identification. You may want to read his own biography and look at his family photos at [56].
What exactly the autobiography is supposed to prove? That he wrote German. And where he identifies himself as German? And what the photos suppose to proof?
>He himself states that his mother Maria and father Simon had a small farm in the same place in Silesia. In other words they were longtime burghers of Silesia, as well as him.
Yes there was. “Name of his great-grandfather Jerzy (1717-1800) appears in the oldest Polish chronicles of Lowkowitz “(W. Kocowicz 1987).
>You look at the church records with birth, marriage, death from Lowkowitz and surrounding area and all his Dzierzon family members, who all wound up after 1945 in Western Germany and you find no traces at all of either him or his parents having moved from Poland to Silesia, Germany.
It only proof that the official language was German and Germanization was on the way look V. Raczek, Erinnerungeu all den Altmelster der Bienenzuclit Dr. Dzierzon
>His grave stone also identifies him as Johann Dzierzon.
The grave stone is repeatedly mentioned by many as proof. The stone was funded by Austrian Beekeepers’ Association and have nothing to do with Dzierzon’s family will. I already mentioned about it in earlier part of the discussion. Lokk up.
>The only Polish people, who came to the Silesian town, I find reference to, is by the way on the current Polish Kluczbork.. (?) site, which tells us that Protestant Polish people took refuge there in the 1600's. We all know, that the Counter-Reformation and the Jesuits 'convinced' the Silesians and others to re-catholizise. Perhaps that is, where Johann Dzierzon had gotten his surname from.
You like to forgot that orginal population of Silesia was Polish people. Look for “Recoveret Teritories” article. The orginal Polish language survived for hundred od years. (It is not exceptional facts you can found such event on Lithuania and others countries where the native language was not changed in vilages) As you can imagine because the schools were fewer.
>I have not seen any self-description of him by himself as a Pole.
I am not surprised of it. German do not publicized such thinks. You need read Polish. You have editions by Polish authors in English. You can find them in “Literature” sections. Also you disbelieve recent Polish authors but you believe on NSDAP propagandists Karl Fleischer (his editions are 50-70 years old). I ask many times for recent German beekeeping historians who says Jan Dzierzon was German.
>The wikipedia Polish group, lead by A Serafin, who is also Nr. 131.. are the only ones with a note from a 1961 book, which is added to the incorrectly named Jan Dzierzon wikipedia article.
The correct name of Jan Dzierzon is Dzierżon the z is with dot above. “Dzierżyć” means to keep in Polish language. What do you mean a note from 1961. All Polish beekeeping historians says Dzierzon was Polish. You just disregard parts which are inconvenient.
>This not only claims, that he said that, but insisting on, that he actually did say that. Where is the actual proof? 
In Kluczbork museum. There is many more interesting thinks about the Polish Dzierzon family and their testimonies. I will encourage you to find proof of yours statement JD was German. Nobody yet give me one except the NSDAP propagandists Karl Fleischer scribbles. Autobiography do not say anything of such, we already know it, is not? 
>That quote, supposedly from him,'identifying himself as a Polish person', actually just says, that his surname is a Polish-based surname.
The citation say: “Regarding my nationality, I AM obviously, just as my name says, Polish of birth, since on Silesia people speak Polish…” in Polish version is: """"Samo moje nazwisko mówi, żem Polak z urodzenia"""" which is “just my name says I AM Pole of birth” Further the sentence says: “because from 10 birthday I found myself in Breslau and I studied there I become German educated, but the education does not accept borders or nationality.” I did not include the other part before as I avoided irritating Germans chauvinists. Now you have it.
Original Polish text: „Co do mojej narodowości, jestem oczywiście, jak już samo nazwisko moje mówi, Polakiem
z urodzenia, gdyż na Śląsku mówi się po polsku, a że od 10 roku życia znalazłem się we Wrocławiu i tam studiowałem, stałem się Niemcem z wykształcenia. Ale nauka nie uznaje granic ani narodowości.”
Original in Museum of. J. Dzierżona in Kluczborku, sygn. 35, 14, 11 Folge, Zur Charakteristik Dr. J. Dzierzon.
Are you really assume that Prussia was an asylum of tolerance and love? If so you would be surprise. Dzierzon did not have a reason to love Prussia.

Now, I learned about the Z++ page in Wikipedia from a friend. I thought I could do a better job, so I spent time to learn Wiki's features and expand on the page. As about the Google search, I have been told about references to Z++, mostly in European forums etc. In some cases that I became interested, I had to use a translator (I was shown how to do that) so I could see what was being said about Z++. Unlike you, those folks had looked at the Z++ syntax chart and were discussing its features.
About the use of .h and namespace, your are making a big guess about Z++ without first trying to understand what Z++ is. You are wrong in guessing that Z++ is an extension of C++, the way C++ extends C by porting Simula classes. No, there is no chance of confusing Z++ files with C header files. The notion of namespace is quite extensive in Z++. Please read more carefully before commenting.
You are wrong in guessing that Z++ is in competition with C++. It is not, nor I care what C++ can or cannot do. However, in order to provide a perspective for illustrating ideas, one has to make references to other known implementations. C++ is such a minimal subset of Z++ that I can simply use C, Simula, ADA, Eiffel and APL in order to provide context for understanding the contributions of Z++ to software development. But then, C++ includes C and Simula, and is known to many.
Mr. Best, had your request for deletion not followed our discussion in the Google's C++ newsgroup, I would have assumed that you are sincere, and would have tried to clarify any confusion. You are simply doing this, and improperly using my last name for what happened there. Please indicate some inconsistency within Z++ language, or explain how you think Z++ is in competition with C++, rather than expressing your dislike.

What I dislike about your proposed version is that it doesn't carry the forms / aspects distinction which was the point of my proposal.

The """"aspects"""" division gives people the power to understand the influence of the liberal tradition by comparing it to other ideologies with these categories in mind. The perfect example is that of """"social conservatives"""" who (can be) economically liberal without being socially liberal.
In any case, if the forms/aspects division is tossed, then I'd rather that those sections called """"cultural"""" and """"political"""" liberalism also be removed, or placed in a different section, since they already describe essential / noncontroversial issues within liberalism.

I do not consider myself to be homophobic and I was just in a very mad mood at that particular time.  I have many friends of all different races, sexual orientations and etc and it never should have been said.  You have been a nice mentor to me and I know you are just trying to follow rules and guidelines.  Some of the rules I disobeyed was not right and I should have brought my opinions on the matter to the talk pages and not continue to have edit wars with other editors.  I realize its not healthy on either side and in the end accomplishes nothing.  I know you know that I loved being an editor on Wikipedia and hope that one day I can be allowed back to the community.  Again, I hope you can accept my apology.  Thanks.",0

Tilden of New York out polled Ohio's Rutherford Hayes in the popular vote, and had 184 electoral votes to Hayes' 185, with 20 votes yet uncounted. These 20 electoral votes were in dispute: in three states (Florida, Louisiana, and South Carolina), each party reported its candidate had won the state, while in Oregon one elector was declared illegal (on account of being an """"elected or appointed official"""") and replaced. The 20 disputed electoral votes were ultimately awarded to Hayes after a bitter legal and political battle, giving him the victory.
110.

Well thank you for at least stepping up and citing some kind of reasoning for what I consider unreasonable actions on the part of others Bob Rayner!

No original research?  Are you kidding me?  Years of research was reported (both failures and successes), that was also physically verified experimentally by over 20 others world-wide, and is cited on my original, and now archived (and now unalterable by me) open.org/davidc website, on both archive.go-here.com and archive.org in Europe.

The past updates on that archive collection details those years of experimental research, including the works of others on the subject around the world, beginning with the first physical verifications by James Hurl of Australia, and follows the story through to the last update before I gave up for a while out of exasperation, due to unrelenting stupidity and prejudice (don't confuse our religiously scientific dogma by citing facts).

The theory of operation I believe is clearly stated, and the """"flat earth"""" prejudice against the subject is apparent in the overall tone and presentation of the balance of the definition of """"Inertial_Propulsion"""".  A lone dissenting voice challenging the current dogma is how ALL of science progresses past the ignorance of yesteryears.

To disallow original research is to attempt to hold ALL of science to a stable state, and ignores the dynamic nature of the search for greater truths than we currently understand.

Science is NOT a BIBLE, and DOGMA is anathema to the entire process of research!

That is """"Charles Sturt's Pondebadgery"""".  I am not 100% sure it is an Indigneous word though I said the place was referred to by it.  That remains correct.  Multiple layer stuff.  I suspect that 'ponde' is cheyanne or sioux as talking to those people its their word, but Sturt may very well have made that name up and I suspect he did.  Some Sioux etc were very much in the Gundagai area but Sturt may have known the word before he went downriver.  It seems he left a ponde downriver also.  Another aussie word that is native american is 'creek'.  We do not blink at its use, ever. Sturt did record the pondebadgery word.  What pondebadgery refers to is appropriate and is in context and association, just the vowles etc do not sound to me that ponde is a Wiradjuri word.  NOTE:  I did not note that it was a wiradjuri word. I only note Wiradjuri words if they have a known ethnology.  Sturt records Warby being at Pondebadgery.  This is the g.g.granddad of Ben Warby who holds the world water speed record.  Warby does not record 'pondebadgery' nor does anyone else in all of Australia's story that I am aware of and I have looked extensively. Just Sturt does though badgery or budgeri is previously recorded.  """"Charles Sturt's Pondebadgery"""" is more correct than what it has been edited to as that edit seperates Sturt from the word when no one knows that at all so its factually incorrect and should not be done as its making something that was correct as it stood, into fiction.  The cod story is very correct.  I can't vouch for the use of 'ponde' in it as being of Indigneous origin, though.""",0

Slovakization is often rationalized as a response to forced magyarization, which happened mainly after the Ausgleich (Compromise of 1867).

""""Several key questions are central to the study of the Beat Generation. The first is whether a Beat Generation actually exists. If the Beat Generation consists of Kerouac, Ginsberg, Burroughs, and a few others, then the Beat Generation does not exist because a generation cannot be based on just a few people. On the other hand, if the Beat Generation includes dozens and dozens of artists, including not only writers but also dancers, painters, sculptors, musicians, then the Beat Generation does not exist because the concept is too loose, too vague.""""

For this one, there may be some confusion by what Kerouac means by “people who had been beaten down” since that could apply to either the small group or the broader subculture. However, Morgan provides the same definition I presented earlier in which Kerouac identifies it as “certain members of the generation that came of age after World War II who affected detachment,” etc. It’s conceivable that one might argue Kerouac meant his group of friends by “certain people, but from many other sources, he meant the broader subculture (open for debate, but let’s have that debate instead of blindly dismissing without evidence to support counterclaims). Here’s the quote from Morgan:

“Once the press began to identify those writers collectively as ‘the Beat Generation,’ some within the group began to struggle with a definition for the word beat. Since it was Jack Kerouac who had originally coined the phrase, he was asked repeatedly what he meant by it. Initially he said that the Beat Generation was composed of people who had been beaten down, worn out, and exhausted. As time passed, he refined his definition to emphasize the beatific, blessed, or sympathetic qualities of his generation.”

"Missing the Forest... 

I just have to add a comment to this talk page, in light of the ongoing struggle over administrator priviledge and userboxes.  I try hard to assume good faith, and I certainly would like to have the same assumed of my actions.  Having contributed a number of userboxes, and finding them deleted without notice, I was confused.  Upon digging deeper, I saw that the problem was much more serious that a few templates being deleted out of process.  There are a number of admins that seem to think that they have the right to dictate to the masses what is and is not acceptable content in the user space.  This is wrong.  User space is where wikipedians are allowed to express their POV, personal convictions, and interests.  Admins do have a responsibility to wikipedia, but first and foremost it should be recognized that wikipedia only exists because of wikipedians.  Actions such as mass purges, mass deletions, and mass edits without explanation, are basically the most disruptive possible avenue available.  In the grand scheme of things, userboxes are basically unimportant, but they have become the most critical issue on the wikipedia at present because they have been attacked by administrators without comment or explanation, outside of process, and with no regard for the impact this has on the community.  I am unhappy with your part in this, Tony, and I expected better.  I feel that admins should learn from their mistakes, and the mistakes of others, but I am afraid I see these being repeated.  If you feel you have the right, then you are welcome to exercise it - but you will destroy the wikipedia if you destroy the desire of wikipedians to participate.

Suburban Express

We would apprciate any guidance you can give us http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard#Guidance_Sought  We feel the Suburban Express article is being dominated by haters, who cry foul whenever and however we push back. We would like to see the article more neutral/balanced/objective.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 99.147.28.113   

Hi. I've made some suggestions at Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard#Guidance Sought.  (talk · contribs · email)  

Hello. As you know, I'm waiting for a pending name change. I've stayed away from posting on the noticeboard until the name change is complete, and I thoroughly appreciate that I have a COI and must not edit Suburban Express. However, I am under the impression that it is permissible for me to contribute to the Suburban Express talk page. One thing that has plagued the article is the fact that conventional-media sources are not necessarily avaialble online. There has been productive discussion on the talk page today, and I am encouraged by that, and I offered up two conventional-media articles, which are pdf's on my company's server  because they do not exist elsewhere on the internet. The links were immediately whacked by OrangeMike:

""""20:46, 27 October 2013‎ Orangemike (talk | contribs)‎ . . (188,881 bytes) (-367)‎ . . (1. You were unblocked so you could get a new username; 2. those were links to your corporate website) (undo)""""

I have two questions: 1) Should I have posted as IP user instead? Or am I just expected to keep quiet until the username change is complete?, 2) What is the issue with the """"corporate website""""? The links are to pdf's of legitimate, unaltered news paper articles.

Your guidance will be appreciated.   — Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

Hi. Sorry. You and I are on opposite sides of the world. That was because Orangemike wants you to create a user name that conforms to WP:ROLE before you do any more communicating here, and he (mistakenly in my opinion) thinks it is a copyright violation to briefly host a link to a copyrighted document while a few people discuss it. 
I don't have time to get involved with your case but my one reading of the article tells me that it needs to say something about the litigation - provided the sources reporting it are strong. If they do conform to Wikipedia:Reliable sources, don't expect to have all mention removed. The quality of the sources can be assessed by independent eyes at WP:RSN or maybe you could attract more independent eyes via a Wikipedia:Request for comment (you should follow that blue link if you don't already know about RFC) on the article's talk page. And the amount of space devoted to the litigation and criticism of it (and the language used) needs independent eyes (maybe at WP:NPOVN or at an RFC if you decide to go down that road).

"Don´t hide correct information, instead help people get access to it 

Hi Tournesol, Wikipedia have never been about consensus. Wikipedia is about making new correct and useful information public for a brooder amount of people quicker and within a shorter time interval than ordinary dictionaries.
This means researchers with a specific knowledge may help other people get access to it and speedup the expansion of the world mainstream knowledge. I think you agree It´s a god deed to share information even if this knowledge is regarded new for the ordinary layman and in the forefront of science.
Wikipedia has never been about satisfying some perverse peoples needs to act as deputies for bureaucratic hegemonies. 
For example, It will be impossible to incorporate pictures in Wikipedia if you can’t give away your own pictures and include your own work as a reference to the same pictures.

 Barnstar, clubyears, etc. 

Just following in your footsteps, haha.  Thanks for the barnstar, by the way!  And what resources are you using for the USL all-time rosters? - I'd be happy to help.

Here's a question: we previously discussed the """"clubyears"""" infobox category for MLS players, and agreed that the clubyears listed should correspond with years played.  I'm going through various Chivas USA players right now, as you saw — finishing up the all-time roster for that club — and noticing how much confusion there has been on this issue over the years at Wikipedia.

I guess I'd propose a uniform standard, based on the way that MLSnet lists player stats (and based on the nature of the league): any season for which a player is rostered with a team is counted into the clubyears section.  For instance, if a guy plays for Colorado in the 2006 season and is traded to Columbus before the 2007 season begins, only 2006 is listed.  But if a guy plays for Colorado in the 2006 season and is traded to Columbus during the 2007 season (June, say), both 2006 and 2007 are listed as years for his Colorado tenure even if he didn't play a match for Colorado during 2007.  I think this is the best way to record years — and, happily, it conforms with the way the league's official site records stats.

I have been thinking that we US-soccer editors might want to have some sort of official """"summit"""" (or meeting, or whatever) on the talk page of the US/Canada WP:FOOTY taskforce...we could nail down guidelines on a number of tricky issues which are particular to American soccer, or at least somewhat unusual...like the exact way to list colleges, the way to list years, when to use accents in names, how to properly disambiguate American players, all kinds of things.  Then we could write these guidelines out and put them up so that newer editors understand how to do things. ''' 《Defender of Open Editing》''' """,0

As you say Prisonermonkeys, the intent is to present the information in a way that is representative of the subject manner: in this case Fiennes has consistantly been credited as 'M' in the lead up to Spectre in official Eon releases, it is in keeping with the precadent set by the earlier films in the Bond series and consistant with the film Spectre where he is referred to as 'M' throughout the film (and only refers to himself once as 'Mallory' at the climax.)

 Advice on Portal:Jurassic Park: 

Hi Firs. I recently found the mentioned portal after it was placed in the related portals section of the dino portal. I checked it out & saw it had a number of problems which were in violation of the fair use policy among others. Firstly, none of the pictures on the portal (all of which are fair use) have fair use rationale. I expressed this to the user (User:Cuddly Panda) who has been the sole contributor of the portal with no reply. On closer inspection, it seems the user has been uploading & adding fair use images to wikipedia for some time now, possibly upwards of a year, & despite numerous warning from automated bots etc, has now seemed to learn from this or the links provided or ceased their image infringements. Just check out the user's talk page - nearly every message is a message about the misuse of uploads. In addition to this, the portal is very poor in quality, unmaintained and relies heavily on unfree images and poor portal sections (some of which have already been nominated for deletion). So I wanted to ask you what action I could take next. There's a few options:

1) Obviously the user is not listening to warnings & my messages, so could I possibly bring this up at the administrator's noticeboard? They could then decide what to do next.
2) Since sections of the JP Portal are being nomianted for deletion already, I could potentially nominate the whole portal at MfD with a vote of """"no opinion"""". This would see what other editors think of the portal & even if it is kept, the portal's fair use pictures problem would still be sorted out by the end of the nomiantion.
3) I'll probably do this anyway, but the user is on Editor Review & I could also place a note there explaining what the user is doing wrong & how to remedy this.

So, I'd personally like to do all three, but if you can think of something else & help me decide which of those, if any, to carry out, it would be appreciated. I'll post this to another admin just to get a second opinion as well. Cheers,  """,0

The book states; The discrepencies in eyewitnesses evidence were substancial and wide-ranging. Each of the fourteen eyewitnesses testified different accounts of what they saw. Some eyewitnesses testified seeing Ryan to the East of Hodson and some eyewitnesses testified seeing Ryan to the West of Hodson. Some eyewitnesses testified seeing smoke coming from Ryan's rifle, although it was established by an expert on forensic ballistics Senior Sergeant Colin Letherbarrow, who testified that the cartridges used were of a smokeless variety. (Eleven eyewitnesses testified they saw Ryan armed with a rifle. All fourteen eyewitnesses testified of hearing one single shot and Hodson fell to the ground. More significantly, only FOUR eyewitnesses testified actually seeing Ryan fire a shot. The was no contest that the evidence of each eyewitness were very contradictory. Purrum's infamous book goes on to describe the discrepencies in the prosecution's case, eg. the lack of scientific forensic evidence, the vital missing pieces of evidence, the downward trajectory angle of the fatal bullet, and prison officer Paterson testifying he fired the single shot that was heard by all eyewitnesses.

 Temporary massive removal of some legendary history 

There were quite a few paragraphs discussing the ancient origins of the Yadavs, but as I was picking my way through it, it appeared a well-nigh impenetrable mass of confusing data, and likely a lot of WP:Synthesis. Terms such as Yadava/Yadav, Ahir/Yadav, and Abhira/Ahir were frequently conflated, and it appeared at many (most?) times that info was included without regard for whether the cited author gave any indication that his topic involved the modern Yadav caste. The info is not """"lost"""", it is cleanly preserved in the History tab, and its removal noted in Edit Summary and here so that any inclined editor can go back through it and carefully select the appropriate portions to re-incorporate. I submit that any info not specifically related to the modern Yadav go into the appropriate other articles such as Yadava and Abhira, etc. and that only material clearly linking the modern Yadavs to those ancient roots be included here. Otherwise, lengthy explanations of past groups with no clear link to the present group constitutes Synthesis, as it implies/pre-supposes a factual linkage when one may not be specified.

Again, I'm not trying to permanently wipe out this info, I just think the section was very unwieldy and contentious, and rather than pick and chip at it, it's better to temporarily wipe the slate clean, and then mine the past drafts to incorporate any usable data.   """,0

There's already Liturgical year, which discusses the Proper of the Season, although it can be a bit confusing since it discusses Catholic and Protestant uses, which aren't always the same. Any article would have to include both the pre- and post-Vatican II calendars, most notably Septuagesima and Passiontide as well as Ordinary Time vs. Time after Epiphany/Pentecost. The only change I see would be to create a specific """"Roman Catholic Liturgical Year"""" article. As for the 1962 Calendar of the Saints, I created the older one mainly because I already had the pre-1955 calendar in electronic format, it's more consistent with past use since Trent, and it includes feasts that were later dropped. I think the same article can be used for both the 1955 and 1962 calendars, adding the rank of feasts (Double/III Class), and some sort of special formatting or asterisks for Feasts which are only on one or the other.  
Re-reading the first comment, I'm also starting to like the idea. We can have one article on the year in general, what effect it has on the liturgy, and the arrangement of the liturgical books, with sections or sub-articles on the Proper of the Season and the Proper of the Saints, both articles discussing the 1955/1962 and 1970 versions.

Karate IS a Japanese martial art, with roots in older Chinese martial arts. Japanese (actually Okinawan) masters of the 19th and early 20th century have changed the art into a new, modern fighting art, just as languages change, like Bihal writes: French is a French language.

You're on an encyclopaedia. It's Wikipedia's job to explain things.

It's pretty obvious what I would have liked to hear from you, but I suppose intentionally ignoring people is the way of Wikipedia. This situation is obviously more complex than you phrased it - I am not 'having a go' at people for not writing the article, I'm having a go at them for having got it deleted for no good reason at all (and while you gave reasons, they're not very good and didn't really address what actually happened anyway, which is presumably why you're not willing to continue discussing it). And I've already given you extensive reasons why 'write it yourself' isn't really going to cut it as a solution. I'm not going to write it, and neither are they. Nobody is going to. Even though it is an eminently appropriate subject for a Wikipedia article, according to Wikipedia's own rules (and a passable first draft already existed). Perhaps we just have different ideas on what's the worst thing Wikipedia could be doing. Me, I think it's this. You, well, you clearly put more value on, well, I don't know to be honest. Obviously you have absolutely no interest in the subject matter, just like Dave (despite his claims), and the others, so I guess it's not really all that important to any of you at all that Wikipedia's already poor coverage of this area just got a little bit poorer, for no good reason, and despite the best efforts of a subject expert to inform you why your reasoning was completely erroneous and was simply flying in the face of common sense (such as the very obvious fact that the list I linked above has several companies on it which are actually smaller than NIBS). Not that you can even tell for half of them, because the articles are so crap they don't even give such basic details as that (for the reasons I've extensively documented). Which merely leaves me still wondering why any of you think this sort of approach would motivate me, or anyone else who realises this is the way of Wikipedia, to fix/write the articles for you. You must really think people are fools.   17:46",0

For the record, below is the controversial text which these morons think needs citations:

The Coyote (canis latrans, or """"prairie wolf"""") also interbreeds with dogs, and many Americans have dogs which are part coyote. The coyote is very closely related to the wolf, and the two can be made to interbreed, but they never do in the wild. Most dog/coyote hybrids are in the domestic population, where the father is the coyote responding to a female dog in estrus, and the puppies are born into captivity. The word coydog was coined in the Eastern US when coyotes began to appear there, as they seemed larger than western coyotes, and it was assumed that they were dog/coyote hybrids. DNA evidence has shown, however, that this is not the case. The Golden Jackal is another wild wolf-like canid which can interbreed with dogs, and it has been crossed with dogs by Russian breeders to created the Sulimov Dog.

Any species of the Canis genus has 78 chromosomes and can interbreed with dogs. These include all varieties of the wolf, the golden jackal, the coyote, the dingo, and the New Guinea Singing Dog. The only 78-chromosome canid which is not thought to have contributed to the dog gene pool is the African wild dog, which is in a separate Genus. However, the vast majority of the DNA in dogs comes from the various Canis lupus varieties. Yellow jackals have 74 chromosomes and don't interbreed well with dogs, and other wild canids such as the bush dog, the maned wolf, and the fox, have different chromosome sets and cannot interbreed with dogs at all, so they played no part in the dog ancestry. See canid hybrid.

Finally, the origin of the dog is so ancient that many now-extinct varieties of wolf, some unknown, may have played a part. It is wrong to say that dogs descended from modern wolves. They descended from ancestral wolves, and this difference must always be kept in mind. Ancestral wolves of many varieties existed all over the planet and were most likely domesticated in many places during a period of thousands of years, and some of these ancestors are now extinct. This helps in explaining the different morphological groupings of dog, as each group may have derived from a different variety of wolf. The common belief that greyhounds and other short-haired dogs descended from modern gray wolves of norhtern climates, and lost their undercoat through human breeding, is weak compared to the argument that these breeds descended from a short-haired wolf of warmer climate. The Arabian Wolf, for example, has short hair suited for its climate""",0

It isn't a theory. A theory is a scientifically acceptable body of principles that explain phenomena in a reasonable manner. People can read alternative views in thousands of blogs, pseudoscience pieces (books, movies, internet). They have no place in an encyclopedia that relies on reliable, verifiable sources. Cheers   

Your definition is incorrect. Einsteins theory of relativity wasn't accepted at all when he presented it, but it was still a quite valid theory. History is full of people rejected by people with your attitude...   

To be quite honest, were not as stupid as people back in the 15th century. We can actually prove these things with exploration and tests. They couldn't. The world CANNOT explode as a result of Global Warming. Its alot tougher than all these enviromentalists give it credit for, however we can't. It would take some extreme heat to cause any harm to the planet. Just because CO2 levels are at there highest in 20 odd million years doesn't mean the earths getting hotter. It means that we're making CO2. Before, there was nothing to add more CO2 to the atmosphere. Now theres us, and the increase is small but its still the highest in 20 million years. Unless we find a way to turn the air into a thick layer of greenhouse gases, the earth will never heat up more than 10 or so degrees, no matter how long you wait.

 Pris and Racheal are the same android 

I'm afraid this is going to be quite a useless comment at the moment, because I don't have the book in front of me to quote from.

However I came to this Wikipedia article originally to see if it could help me decide whether Pris and Rosen are in fact the same android (not just the same model).  The article makes no mention whatsoever of something that has really been puzzling me.

Why do I think that Racheal and Pris might be one and the same:

- Pris originally introduces herself as Racheal Rosen when meeting JR Isidore and then changes her mind and calls herself Pris (if Pris is simply using her name for cover how do she know her?)
- Deckard says that Racheal and Pris have the same eyes (in fact the only difference he notes are clothes)
- We hear no more from Racheal after Pris has been killed (I'm assuming there she killed the goat before she went over to the conapt building)
- When Pris runs towards Deckard before she dies her last words are along the lines of """"For all we meant to each other.""""  Surely they don't know each other at all; Pris and Deckard have never met if she is someone else.
-  Pris also runs towards him from outside the conapt as opposed to inside it - i.e. she has been following Deckard as Racheal and not holed up with the rest of the Andys
- Racheal is really distraught in the hotel room when she finds out about Pris being the last android, it would make much more sense for her fear to be because it is her rather than the same android model.  It is only when she offers to kill it herself that she calms down.  But then she would - she had just claimed to kill herself (i.e. bluff Pris' death or possibly commit suicide).

Admittedly there's a couple of snags.  If she is Racheal then she is working for the Rosen corporation, so why is she hiding with the runaways?  Unless she """"ran away"""" from the corporation after Deckard originally tested her.  

Anyway I'd like to add something to the article - obviously nothing conclusive, but just acknowledge the possibility.  But if anyone would like to blow a huge smoking hole in my theory that I haven't thought of, then I won't (and it would stop me putting more time into trying to figure this one out too, which would be handy).

I'll have a think about this.  Some of it amounts to, hmm, not a basic civility, but an outright encouragement.  I'd like to take that up.  Sometimes, however, a citation formatting decline is due to fundamental errors.  I think a Comments with a lapse is better for the first type.  I'm still sticking with Decline for the second type.
A third case is 2c errors concealing 1c errors.  Often real 1c checking can't begin without appropriate citations.  Perhaps this is a subset of the second kind of problem, where citation formatting consistency causes a decline.
Jargon is harder.  Citations are a jargon driven field.  This is mostly where I'll be thinking about it.

 Liver regeneration and the Greeks 

On this page and the Prometheus page, someone has added a reference giving a bogus definition for the Greek word for liver, hêpar, claiming that it  derives from the verb hêpaomai, meaning to mend or repair. Thus hêpar is supposed to translate as, """"repairable."""" This derivation is fanciful. I'm surprised it lasted as long on Wiki as it has since it wasn't even confirmed by the original source given! I've deleted this bogus definition. I doubt you need references for a deletion, but here are some anyway: J. Pokorny, Indogermanisches etymologisches Wörterbuch (Bern and Munich: Francke, 1959), pp. 325, 504; P. Chantraine, Dictionnaire étymologique de la lange grecque (Paris: Klincksieck, 1990), p. 414; H. Frisk, Griechisches etymologisches Wörterbuch, Vol. I (Heidelberg: Carl Winter, 1973), pp. 638-9. These sources make it very doubtful that hêpar was related to hêpaomai.

I've also changed some text in the section on Liver Regeneration which asserted that the myth of Prometheus proves that the ancient Greeks must have known about the liver's remarkable capacity to repair itself. Actually this is a matter of some dispute. I've changed the text to reflect this controversy. I’ve looked at a great deal of literature on the subject and have found only one attempt to actually argue that the Greeks knew about liver regeneration: Chen T and Chen P (1994). """"The Myth of Prometheus and the Liver."""" Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine 87(12): 754-755. I've added a reference and link to this. I've also referenced and linked to a historically detailed critique of this position: Power C and Rasko J (2008). """"Whither Prometheus' Liver? Greek Myth and the Science of Regeneration."""" Annals of Internal Medicine 149(6): 421-426. This is by far the most comprehensive treatment of this topic.

The addition of the above references made an existing reference redundant (ie Michalopoulos, George K., and DeFrances, Marie C., """"Liver regeneration”. Science, 4 April 1997: Vol. 276. no. 5309, pp. 60-66), so I removed it. Like a great many articles on regenerative medicine, the Michalopoulos article simply asserts that the Greeks must have known about liver regeneration, citing the the myth of Prometheus as its only evidence. Chen and Chen go much further than this. Likewise Power and Rasko.

"It's clear that TheOldJacobite is doing nothing more than what he accuses others of... E.g. Not adhering to Wiki policy, constantly breaching anti-reversion rules and generally trolling to try and start editing wars with new editors. His latest revert - after admin decision - is clearly spiteful vandalism.
1) he left the article in an unreferenced state for months, and made no attempt to clear them up or remove them.
2) he took exception to an entry that was referenced properly, including a reference to the BBC - the BBC being a reference source for other items on this page, yet hypocrisy reared its head and TheOldJacobite failed to acknowledge, only finally accepting when having the nonsense of his illogical inconsistent application of policy pointed out.
2a) he also claimed that the newspaper source included wants notable enough despite having a readership level that warranted its own actual entry in Wikipedia - a newspaper that has been published for over 100 years.
3) he continually reverts the repair of the included entry, which meets ALL Wiki policies. These are reverted accordingly by me as they breach no rules but simply have some personal issue with TheOldJacobite. Maybe TheOldJacobite thinks he owns the page. Who knows what motive lies behind the behaviour?
4) He then summons up 'help' from a sock-buddy who also removes it and then threatens me with blocking because he can't gets his own way. That editor has no and rights so simply reverts to threats and bravado against a new user. it should be noted that Sjo has been previously warned on his page about treating new editors with contempt and warning him to stop simply removing new edits, so a behaviour pattern that is common to both of them.
5) TheOldJacobite then has me referred to admin for alleged vandalism - no action is taken. TheOldJacobite also tries to make me out as some sort of vandal purely because I have an IP rather than a full username...this is just childish diversion tactics,
6) TheOldJacobite requests the page is locked - no action is taken as admins clearly don't agree. If anything it should be locked against him reverting a totally acceptable entry.
7) Electric Wombat (admin) reviews the entry and determines it's good for inclusion and asks all to stop the edit war. I agree but would like to see an equal admonishment made to TheOldJacobite and Sjo for their arbitrary editing, non equitable application of policy and the gang-up bullying mentality against a new user. But, I won't hold my breath as I've seen all of TheOldJacobite's and Sjo's disciplinary record and it's clear that nothing really gets done about trolls like these so-called [editors] who simply delight on playing judge and jury and clearly think they own Wikipedia.
8) Despite Electric Wombat's decision of inclusion, TheOldJacobite again reverts the entry.  this is clearly against strict Wiki rules about reverting after an admin decision has been made. I wonder if ThOldJacobite will be blocked temporarily for sticking two fingers up at the admin team?
9) I have now applied the admin decision and reverted it back to what it was before TheOldJacobite vandalised it yet again.
10) I am wondering if Wikipedia is broken beyond repair when it allows personal and prejudicial views of editors like TheOldJacobite and Sjo to interfere with the mission statement of Wikipedia to create a globally-contributed knowledge base.",0
"Odd - the 9th Legion seems to have got a kicking everywhere it went. No, not the same battle. Clearly there are now (at least) three in Britain we know about.

The third involved Boadicea, who was a warlord(ess) way to the South, who seems to have given the 9th (it's THIRD reformation?) another kicking. 
Reading more about the first attack, it seems to fit very nicely into your Night Combat article, because it succeeded only because it was carried out at night - an advance unit snuck in the fort, opened the gates, and the hordes rushed in.

"""

Well, upon reviewing my original post I would like to moderate my original statements because I understand the confusion between the term """"Christmas"""" and the related practices.  It is my belief that we must clarify in the minds of laypeople(and people of other cultures) that Christmas is a commonly used term, often commercial, sometimes secular and used to apply to all seasonal celebrations, i.e. """"state Christmas tree"""", when in fact the united states government is not affiliated with any particular religion.

I would like to insist that the opening paragraph is highly bias and simply incorrect as it stands now:

1) Defines the Christian history of a celebration
2) Brief history
3) Anecdote
4) Note on the fallacy of placement of the celebration
5) Secular statement, as though the """"Christmas tree"""" and """"Santa Claus"""" are secular in origin, which they are not.

The way to fix this is to separate the term Christmas from the seasonal celebrations in the minds of readers.  Christmas is a commonly used religious and secular term first.  Second, it is a Christian celebration of a Jewish man's birth. 

Revised suggestion:
1) Define Christmas as a commonly used term
2) Christian definition of the celebration
3) Brief history of celebrations 
4) Note on the Christian placement of the holiday
5) Accurate attribution of Christmas, brief origins of 

Proposed pp:
Christmas is a """"[Christianized] term"""" for a traditional holiday practiced by many cultures throughout the world; the term is often used in a secular and commercial capacity. Christmas (literally, the Mass of Christ) is a holiday in the Christian calendar, usually observed on December 25, which celebrates the birth of the man, Jesus Christ.  The first Christmas celebration took place in Rome about the middle of the fourth century. The exact date of the nativity is not known, but the period from December 25 to January 6 — now known as """"The Twelve Days of Christmas"""", is traditionally a time of celebration for many cultures throughout the world.

Additionally:
I would like to ask that all references in the article precisely identify that """"Jesus"""" is Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ.  My Christian friends should also support this request, as my Mexican gardener is also named Jesus and I am left wondering which Jesus you are celebrating, lol.

Whether a particular comparison to Hitler or Nazis is rhetorically persuasive or is excessive (and thus weakens the impact of appropriate comparisons) is not a matter of hard, objective fact (validity, or truthfulness) but, at least in instances where reasonable minds might differ, a matter of subjective appropriateness and degree.

Several years ago the New York Times published a letter of mine, but edited out my correct use of the subjunctive case. When I questioned the editor (very politely and deferentially), he explained the subjunctive is no longer used in modern English except for an assertion contrary to fact (e.g., """"If the Earth were flat, then ..."""")—which my subjunctive usage in the letter happened to be, although I continue to use the subjunctive wherever it is grammatically correct. Was I asleep when the subjunctive case was ripped from my language? Did the Anglos [sic] and Saxons posthumously defeat the Romans and seize linguistic dominance while I was away?

When I was in 4th grade, the teacher taught the class said that it was incorrect to begin a sentence with because. I asked why, and gave her a grammatically correct example of the usage. She acknowledged that my example was correct, but said one should not begin a sentence with because because that often leads to error (she was probably concerned about sentence fragments, e.g., """"Because it rained.""""). To this day, probably because of my resentment of the teacher dumbing down the language, I begin a disproportionate proportion of my sentences with because.

Reference for Micheli Judgment is secondary source GTrial
28-Apr-2010: This is a reminder that the huge Italian text, used as a reference for the Micheli Judgment, is a secondary source as merely a summary (though huge), at website www.Penale.it, of the Judge Paolo Micheli's court document. Several editors have mistakenly thought it was a primary source, because it is so large and contains many details from the original text. The reference has been listed, in the article, as:
 """"Judgement 28.10.2008"""", Dr. Paolo Micheli, dep. 2009-01-26, Court of Perugia Italy, trial of Rudy Hermann Guede, (Google Translation, Italian to English)  Translate.google.com, Italian webpage: Penale.it. Retrieved 2009-12-11.
In that gigantic summary document, many sections have been abridged by indicating ellipsis by 2-dot marks """"(..)"""" in many portions of the text. Some of the omitted details are forensic measurements that pinpoint items in a room. The copyright (at bottom) is:
 © 2006 Copyright Penale.it - SLM - Nyberg Srl 1999-2006Tutti i diritti riservati (English: All rights reserved)
Perhaps some text describing the actual Micheli Judgment """"Motivazioni sentenza per Rudy Guede"""" (the primary source) should be added into the article, as one of the many key details not yet included in the text (Note: in Italian titles, typically only the first word and proper nouns are capitalized). Again, reftag """"GTrial"""" is a secondary source (not a primary source) summarizing, on an Italian website, the much larger Micheli Judgment document. -Wikid77 """,0

I and I alone provided for mankind the most powerful machine since the dawn of time. I was foolish to think I'd get a meeting with the president or the Nobel peace prize. I guess I had my little finger cocked the wrong political way when I did it. Since this was known the forces that be have turned their evil cannons of jealousy toward me and ignored every rule in the book, played every unfair card in the book known and made as many unfair ones they could get their hands on to destroy me and steal it and gain credit for themselves on it. You have to decide if you are on the side of truth and life that I intended for this technology to bring or allow those lord high felons to destroy me with unfair and unequally applied rules. Are you going to be a part of that? Why do I say this? Because if I don't stand no honest person will forever thereafter. Have Wikipedia editors blocked William R. Buckley for the admitted first attack here and thereafter continual attacks, one short one and he's back at it,... or blocked SteveBaker for vandalism at all as he continues to do now and do as much damage to me he can? No. Or punished those dealing out blocks to me when they knew I did nothing for political bias? Did Wikipedia give me credit for my work and ban the copyright infringer and ultimate dark and threatening talker Freitas and Merkle  from this place NO! 

Wikipedia's rules clearly allow the publishing of lies from longer standing people of note, no mater how nefariously they slam the up and coming and tell lies far and wide and Wikipedia knowingly lets them. This is a media rag, period. Like any other. There are no real rules when they apply differently to one than another. Further, again, if you are being destroyed by unfair rules you have a Boston Tea party. Get it? It's called """"self defense"""" something you clearly do not understand. The only rule is a fair one and I don't see you or any other here trying to keep them fair in any way form of fashion you are just blowing political smoke. If you did we would not be here. I have not once been treated fairly and I don't see you doing it or anyone here that bothers to hang around here. You speak of rules, then block those that wrongly attacked me first before I even had a chance to play fair. Before I stuck my head out of the womb as a newbie around here. Don't walk away when I am being punished wrongly and you know it and above all don't drag my good name through the mud like a pig would do Mr. media guy. If you treat me fairly, you would be the first, from Larry King to Don and Mike to the Chief of police in Prince William County Virginia who had me arrested five times knowing I was innocent saying I was crazy for just talking about a self-replicator, even with my patent in my hand, gold seal and all (and you won't write of that here, not fairly). You want fair rules start making and enforcing them fairly and changing the unfair ones here starting here and now (but you wont). But most of all punish those who start the transgressions, not those fighting to defend themselves from the initial onslaught. And do not tell me you do not have special preferences around here.

I have contacted every lawyer on the list at the patent office and they will not sue a university professor (to answer you that question). Do me a fair article and you will never hear from me again because I am only here to fight a bad bio attack on me, that is all. I don't like Wikipedia because the rules are unfair here,woirse than any other media operation I've known.

Re: The Chancers page
Hello there, and welcome to Wikipedia. To answer your question, Wikipedia has a notability guideline, which tries to distinguish between """"notable"""" content (from Wikipedia point of view, a notable topic is one that can be included as article) and """"non notable"""" (content that may be in the future included, but as of now, not). According to our specific music notability guidelines, in order to justify an article, a band needs to fulfill any of these points. From what you wrote in that page, none of those points were fulfilled. If the band passes any of those points, you can include an article in Wikipedia. However, note that you will have to give references for such achievement, otherwise it will be speedy deleted (deleted within minutes of creation because of lack of notability). Even if it fulfills a point, note that Wikipedians can send the article to deletion (either because the notability reference is found to be fake or disputed, unverifiable or otherwise non notable), where wikipedians will discuss if the article is indeed notable by our guidelines, and decide whether it is deleted or not.

 I don't get it. 

So if someone would be to travel through time, their actions would have no effect?

But time travel itself affects the past  you're taking something from the present and putting it in a different point in time, thus, for the context of the earlier point in time you travel to, introducing matter/energy/whatever that didn't exist there before, thus (as per chaos theory) possibly screwing up everything. Any successful travel through time would have an effect, otherwise it wouldn't be time travel.

With that in mind  does the principle boil down to """"time travel is only possible if it has no effect, thus time travel (the possibility of which necessitates having an effect) is not possible""""?

The matter and energy of which the time traveller (and his clothing, etc) consists would (if the universe is a closed system) have been in use by something else at an earlier point in time and thus a re-allocation of matter and energy already existent at that earlier point in time to recreate the time traveller doesn't seem to be a viable alternative either. But if the time traveller can neither be composed of matter and energy that didn't exist, nor of that which already existed but was """"in use"""" already, what does he consist of?

Even if the universe is not a temporally closed system (i.e. matter/energy can vanish and re-appear at future points in time), for something to vanish in the present and re-appear in the past, it would have to vanish before its original appearance unless it can't exist twice at the same point in time (i.e. if atom A was sent back in time from a point Z to a point X, it would vanish at point Z (now) and appear at point X (back then) as A', but have to vanish again as time advances closer to the point Y (somewhere before point Z) where it was originally introduced as A, otherwise A and A' (which should be identical) would exist at the same point in time, which would definitely be an alteration of past events and thus incompatible with the principle.

I'm assuming the principle isn't based on the simplification of the idea that the only thing that """"matters"""" is the action/inaction of humans (as in the interpretation of Schroedinger's experiment that the cat is in an unknown state where it is both alive and dead until the human interacts with it  which implies the human's perception determines the state of reality). If that is true, then the example from Twilight Zone where someone goes back in history to start the fire he travelled back in time to prevent is clearly contradictory as it introduces a paradox (a time travel having to have occurred in order for the time travel to occur) unless it actually changed the events (i.e. originally the fire would have been caused by something else), which would still be inconsistent with the principle which doesn't allow for any changes of the past.

I'm aware this post is getting a bit rant-y, but I'm seriously at a loss here. How does time travel NOT change the past, regardless of whether it has any consequences in the grand scheme of things or not? The very concept of travel backwards through time is that one appears at an earlier point of time, thus changing the past.

The only possibility I can think of for time travel not to change the past is a paradox in which the time travel happens because it has already occurred (i.e. the future representation (person A') of someone (person A) appears in the present and at some future point in time the same events cause person A to travel back in time that """"already"""" caused person A' to go back in time, i.e. both of their time lines are identical), but in which there is no """"other"""" time line in which the time traveller didn't already appear before travelling back in time (i.e. there is no time line in which person A travels back in time without person A' having travelled in time already, i.e. where person A doesn't eventually become person A', the time traveller).

All of this is obviously rendered null and void if the laws of physics are inconsistent and random stuff does appear out of thin air for no reason. —  (talk · contribs) """,0

 Wikipedia lying liars & their lies...  http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html 

There are some regular writers on Wikipedia who knowingly engage in personal attacks and deletions (even of links) of anyone who explains the connection between Edward Bellamy and his cousin Francis Bellamy (author of the pledge of allegiance) and National Socialism. It is behavior that breaks Wikipedia's rules. What kind of people cover-up for Nazis and that horrid ideology?

Many regular writers on Wikipedia are lying liars and the lies they tell include the top media cover-ups. They cover up many historic photos of the Pledge of Allegiance http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html that reveal its original straight-arm salute.  They cover up the fact that the author of the Pledge of Allegiance (Francis Bellamy), and his cousin and cohort (Edward Bellamy), were National Socialists and supported the """"Nationalism"""" movement, the """"Nationalist"""" magazine, the """"Nationalist Educational Association,"""" their dogma of """"military socialism,"""" and Edward inspired the """"Nationalist Party.""""  They cover up the Pledge's straight-arm salute as the origin http://rexcurry.net/pledge1.html of the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis). As part of the cover up, they perpetuate the myth http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html that the straight-arm salute was from ancient Rome.  They cover up discoveries by the historian Rex Curry.  The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched outward toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html showing the evolution of the gesture. Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html is an extended military salute. A mnemonic device is the swastika (""""Hakenkreuz"""" in German).   Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent """"S"""" letters for their """"socialism.""""  Hitler altered his own signature http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html to use the same stylized """"S"""" letter for """"socialist."""" Wikipedia's liars cover up for the swastika http://rexcurry.net/swastikanews.html and its use as a sick socialist symbol. Wikipedia's liars cover up for the National Socialist German Worker's Party http://rexcurry.net/swastikamedia.html by overuse of the hackneyed shorthand """"Nazi.""""  Many Wikipedia posters are liars in that there was no """"Nazi Party"""" because it was actually the """"National Socialist German Workers' Party"""" and the party members did not call themselves """"Nazis"""" nor the """"Nazi Party.""""    The term """"Nazi"""" developed from slang using the first syllable in the German pronunciation of the """"National Socialist German Workers' Party.""""  In that sense, the author of the Pledge of Allegiance was a """"Nazi"""" too, in that the term means """"National Socialist.""""  The term """"Nazi"""" is also used to hide the National Socialist dogma behind the Pledge of Allegiance, its original gesture, and the National Socialist German Workers' Party.   

Wikipedia's liars use the term """"Nazi"""" and the misnomer """"Nazi Party"""" to cover-up the horrors of socialism. Wikipedia's liars cover up the the socialist trio of atrocities and and their socialist Wholecaust (of which the Holocaust was a part): 62 million people were slaughtered under the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; 35 million were slaughtered under the Peoples' Republic of China; 21 million were slaughtered under the National Socialist German Workers' Party. They cover up the fact that socialists helped start WWII with the National Socialist German Workers' Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics together  http://rexcurry.net/socialistwar.html as allies in 1939. They cover up for and are deniers of the socialist Wholecaust, http://rexcurry.net/mediacoverup.html of which the monstrous Holocaust was a part.

Liars on Wikipedia repeat common lies http://rexcurry.net/mediapledge.html of the media. http://rexcurry.net/socialistmedia.html

Wikipedia should not be cited for support because it is no different than quoting various anonymous sources who have no knowledge of the topic http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html or who have lies to spread about the topic.

The Wikipedia article for the """"Roman salute"""" used to be complete disinformation, deliberately maintained by liars who tried to perpetuate myths.  Here is an excerpt of what Wikipedia used to carry: """"The Roman salute is a closed finger, flat-palm-down hand raised at an angle (usually 45 degrees) and was used by the Roman Republic. It was also the historical civilian salute of the United States, from 1787?-1934?, known since 1892 as the Bellamy salute. It was also the historical salute among armies of the Middle East and South America.",0

Sincerely yours,User Winston Smith describes you as “the worst editor I have EVER encountered on wikipedia” while encouraging you to “Please stop this childish behavior.”

""""Chávez was raised a Roman Catholic, although he has had a series of disputes with both the Venezuelan Catholic hierarchy and Protestant groups like the New Tribes Mission.

I appreciate your opinion and that is why I am asking you to justify why we should ignore the sources for alternative names of those people. You are right that these people are known as """"Makedonski Muslimani"""" (more accurately - Makedonci Muslimani) or Torbeši, but there are evidences that there are more alternative names and they aren't outdated. There is external link in the article which isn't added by me. Please, look the text in it - """"Muslims in Macedonia belong to five ethnic groups. These are Albanians, Turks, Roma, Muslim Macedonians ( also known as Torbeshi, Pomaks or Poturs) and Bosnians"""".....""""A Greco-Turkish Convention on the Obligatory Exchange of Populations in 1923 made some 390,00 Muslims mostly Turks, but also some Pomaks (Torbesi)-leave for Turkey (Ortakovski, 1997:133)"""". Is this text is about the same people or it isn't?
The question about the other two names is the same and there is sources from nowadays which proved it. The book by Russian author Dmitriy Labauri is from 2008. The term there is Bulgarian Pomaks. Through the good finding, made by Подпоручикъ we have a reference to Fihret Adanir. The term used by him is Bulgarian Muslims. Between other references there is a book Поп Антов, Христо. Спомени, Скопje 2006 (Pop Antov, Hristo. Memoires, Skopje 2006). The author used consistently the term Pomaks, describing these people, but the editor (Professor Zoran Tododrovski from Republic of Macedonia) have not considered it necessary anywhere in the book to explain what that means (if the term is ineligible) or that this is outdated term.
Concerning your claims that these people have been called """"Bošnjaci"""" in the past, can you provide some references? It is interesting for me.  """,0

 Edit request on 26 February 2012 

Pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS) is a syndrome in which children have abrupt, dramatic onset of Tourette's Syndrome, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), or anorexia nervosa coincident with the presence of two or more neuropsychiatric symptoms.  It is believed that these children experience a rise in dopamine levels as a result of a of cross-reactive anti-neuronal antibodies triggered by streptococcal or mycoplasma infection.  The cross-reaction is believed to cause such side effects as tics.

  
No.  1.  You are misreading the source.  Tics are hypothetically a feature of PANS, but you've extended that to TS, which misses the whole point of the PANS hypothesis.  PANS is hypothetically posed as a condition in which symptoms are not better explained by another condition such as Tourette's, so your text is wrong.  Second, there is exactly one paper written about PANS, it is a proposal, see WP:RECENTISM, and there is no reason to include speculative text in a Featured article.  If more papers are published, and if PANS gains some widespread medical consensus, and if secondary reviews discuss it, then you might propose accurate text here discussing the situation. I'm a bit concerned that you are editing both PANDAS and PANS, and yet your definition of the hypothetical PANS above does not seem to match the cited source, which discusses abrupt onset of OCD.  Furthermore, PANS is proposed for research purposes until there is more coverage, it doesn't belong in this (an unrelated) article.   (Talk)

 Using contemporary computational technology, it would take on the order of 10250 years to exhaust all possible 2-colourings of graphs of size 43.

The main reason is that it is simply not true. Nobody would try to look at all possible colourings one at a time as there are much better ways.  Looking at all colourings is not possible for graphs of size greater than 13 (and very expensive for size 13), yet many larger Ramsey numbers can be found exactly via computer search.

 I know as I have not been able to find out how many amps the receiver and transmitter drew is what happened on the flight to Hawaii. We know about when the generator went off line and we know when they landed. The rest is deduction. What I cannot tell you is if they were down on an island on their belly, (see Lambrechts opinion of landing chances on Gardener) how long they could operate their radios. Or if their electrical system would have been intact enough to function. I grew up in the age of the vacuum tube and know that it would take a minute or two - to 'warm' up the dynamotor and transmitter to the point where it would achieve full power. This is all assuming they had no serious damage to the airplane. My 'best guess"""" (OPINION, don't ask me to put it in the article) is that they probably had at least one hour of operation. The other question is how much """"gain"""" they would have gotten from a """"less than optimum"""" (to quote the TIGHAR radio guy) length under 1/8 wave, V-type antenna sitting less than six feet off the ground. The answer is probably - but not definitely - not much. We are looking at an actual output from the antenna of perhaps 10-20 watts with a horizontal polarity and bad angle. Perhaps they were heard. Odds are they were not. (I repeat this is OPINION). Still we need to consider these things. My guess is that Earhart (OPINION) could have transmitted and received for at least 1 hour. That she could have done one or the other longer. One must remember that a dynamotor was a pretty inefficient means of turning low DC voltage into high voltage AC for radio communications, thus the receiver alone would have more operational life than the transmitter (once again, we do not know how many minutes the xmitter or receiver were on during the Hawaii flight, but a good guess is that they both ran all the time). That the propagation characteristics of her antenna and the frequencies she was able to operate on severely limited any possible range. I find it far easier to think that reports of a 'weak carrier"""" or 'feeble and unintelligible"""" communications being hear are far more likely than someone who claimed to hear her 4/5.

The bottom line - in my humble (and we all know how humble I am) - opinion is that given the best of circumstances, they would have had at least one hour of radio time left if they were out of fuel. """,0

CorpseFucking Art (C.F.A.) are an Brutal Death Metal/ deathgrind band, from  Italy formed in 1993. Their lyrics focuses mainly on gore and Humor.

Biography

The band was formed in Rome in 1993. With the first line-up (Max - gurgling, Andrea - guitars, Fabio - bass, Marco - drums) under a different name Enthralment and recorded their first demo called Eulogy Of Burning Christ. The official sound was a slow and brutal death-metal influenced by Immolation and Incantation.

Cryptic Soul Productions signed Enthralment released the 7"""" Accursed In Divinity. However. the sound contained in the new tracks were defenitely more brutal oriented. As the musical direction was no longer the same as the beginning, it was useless to keep the old name. The one choosen for this new form of madness was Corpsegod. With a different name but same line-up, they recorded in 1995 the mini cd Opinion About Sorrow released by Torture Records. The mini cd contained 5 tracks of original and strange brutal death-metal. Ultrabrutal riffing with techno and industrial parts, splatter movies - Opinion About Sorrow a really vanguard record compared to the others on the death-metal scene.

Though, the passion for the ultrabrutal death-metal in the band was getting higher and higher. The old line-up went to create a new band totally devoted to the brutal death-metal without compromises. A new band was born then, Corpsefucking Art. From the old line-up Andrea and Max were still there. After recording a 2 tracks promo with the new line up (Massimo - guitar, Marcello - drums, Edo - bass) and the track Molesting The Corpse for the underground splatter movie Sick-o-pathic soundtrack. The band played as support for Cannibal Corpse and Immolation for a show in Rome. Corpsefucking Art recorded their debut CD named A Puzzle Of Flesh for the italian label Sterminio Productions. Nine tracks of blasting ultrabrutal death-metal without mercy. An inhuman voice and a blasting riffing made A Puzzle Of Flesh known in the underground.

In 2001 the line-up changed again. Andrea the only member from the first line up joined up with Marco (bass) and Stuart (drums). They recorded a new split CD with Goretrade Zombiecronomicon distributed by Coagulated Records. In april 2002, United Guttural Records took the license by Coagulated records and restamped the split cd with Goretrade, released with a completely new artwork.

After being offered a contract by Forever Underground, Corpsefucking Art entered the studio to record their new full length Splatter Deluxe with the new second guitarist Marco Riccardi. Between the recording and the long wait to the new cd to be out, the band takes part in a lot of live performances including festival in Frankfurt with Lividity, Gorerotted, Inhumate, Pigstry, Nunwhore Commando 666, Mastic Scum, Master and Damnable and the rest of Europe in places like Sweden, France and Italy. The band is currently, in 2008, recording a new studio album and is aspected to come out early 2009.

We want a function f satisfying f(1)=e and f(n+1)=exp(f(n)), defined as widely as possible. We observe that n=0 and n=1 present no problems: f(0)=1 and f(-1)=0.

To extend f to all positive real numbers, it is clearly sufficient to define f on an interval of length 1, such as [0,1).

And we want f to be continuously differentiable. (The paper only requires f to be continuously differentiable on (0,1), or equivalently on (-1,0). This is obviously whacky, but we needn't worry about this because a=e.)

Next, for no obvious (or explained) reason we require that f ' is monotone on the interval [0,1]. From the functional equation f(x) = ln f(x+1) we get f '(x) = f '(x+1)/f(x+1). Hence f '(-1)=f '(0)/f(0)=f '(0), so f ' must be constant on [0,1]! 

Not too surprisingly, the function we get in this way is patched together from smaller pieces in a relatively unnatural way: f(x) = exp[x](exp(x-[x])).

Thus what I learned from the paper is that the correct solution to the problem probably has a minimum of its derivative between -1 and 0.",0

 Request for deletion reconsideration 

I would like to ask to have the deletion of the page ANA SANTIAGO be reconsidered on the following grounds:

A. This person has founded and heads the only Impact Evaluation Network in Latin America and the Caribbean.

3. The person has created, or played a major role in co-creating, a significant or well-known work, or collective body of work, that has been the subject of an independent book or feature-length film, or of multiple independent periodical articles or reviews.
4. The person's work either (a) has become a significant monument, (b) has been a substantial part of a significant exhibition, (c) has won significant critical attention, or (d) is represented within the permanent collections of several notable galleries or museums.""""

B. Further, this person is part of the very small team of persons that have been given the mandate from the Haitian government to redesign a major reform and reconstruction of Haiti's education system following the 2010 earthquake. This has been cited in other pages such as MARCELO CABROL

C. Finally, she leads the all the research and evaluation of one of the main Multilaterals (IDB) on Education topics, directly responsible for ongoing pilots and evaluations for over 200 million dollars. Part of this work has been taking the implementation and designing the impact evaluation of the Teach for America (national teaching corps) model to the region currently in place in Chile, Peru, Argentina, Brazil, and Colombia.

Ah...I see you're refusing to reply! I once read a story about someone who refused to do things, except in this case it was about someone who refused to listen to instructions and advice. It was set in a small village being terrorised (and when I say """"terrorised"""", I make no reference to terrorism) by a Big Bad Wolf (not, of course, referring to the Doctor Who Bad Wolf, but to the Big bad Wolf in the article linked to).

Anyway, this boy who refused to listen to instructions and advice decided to scare everyone, so he told them that the wolf was coming to eat them. They all believed him, and started running around like headless chickens (and it being a farming village, quite possible the chickens would have run around like headless chickens too, only they wouldn't have been headless at that point, probably). Anyway, they eventually found out that there was no wolf coming to eat them, and got very cross with the boy who refused to listen to instructions and advice. They told the boy who refused to listen to instructions and advice never to tell lies like that again.

The next day, this boy who refused to listen to instructions and advice decided to scare everyone, so he told them that the wolf was coming to eat them. They all believed him, and started running around like headless chickens (and it being a farming village, quite possible the chickens would have run around like headless chickens too, only they wouldn't have been headless at that point, probably). Anyway, they eventually found out that there was no wolf coming to eat them, and got very cross with the boy who refused to listen to instructions and advice. They told the boy who refused to listen to instructions and advice never to tell lies like that again.

And the next day, the Big Bad Wolf really did come, and the first person it found was the boy who refused to listen to instructions and advice. And the boy who refused to listen to instructions and advice shouted for help, and everyone ignored him, because they thought that the boy who refused to listen to instructions and advice was simply trying to scare them by saying that the Big Bad Wolf was hungry again. And so the Big Bad Wolf ate the boy who refused to listen to instructions and advice, and lived happily ever after.

Actually, when I say that I read the story, actually I must confess that I was told it when I was at Fifestead Grammar School, because what happened was that I set the fire alarm off, and everyone panicked, and thought that there was a fire. And the headmaster took me into his office and told me this story. Anyway, do you see the connection with yourself ignoring my messages and the boy who refused to listen to instructions and advice?

  Old English (also called Anglo-Saxon, Englisc by its speakers) is an early form of the English language that was spoken and written in parts of what are now  England and southern Scotland between the mid-5th century and the mid-12th century.
 

  Middle English is the name given by linguistics to the diverse forms of the English language spoken between the Norman invasion of 1066 and the mid-to-late 15th century.
 

  Early Modern English is the stage of the English language used from about the end of the Middle English period (the latter half of the 15th century) to 1650.
 

Being that this is my specialist (degree) subject and I am one of the few people who are actually able to read and speak Englisc (along with the old Frisian and Norse dialects which contributed to it), you are more than welcome to take me on about the reliability of those sources; but I don't fancy your chances )   09:15",0

I don't disagree in principle with anything you've written above. I would have no problem with a much stricter notability policy that favored importance over other concerns. However, what you or I might prefer takes  or should take  a back seat to what is. And what is does not require so stringent a standard, at least the way I read the current notability standards. In my view, David Boothroyd met these standards  though barely so  even before the minor scandal. After it, I think there's no question he does. While I share your concerns regarding the future of such articles, the article as it currently stands in userspace presents no viable BLP concerns as far as I can tell.
On a tangent, I am actually considering reworking the notability standards in a way that addresses your concerns above as my first Wikipedia-space project. There are so many """"nobodies"""" that have articles currently that I think this is a rather necessary change. As this would be a major shift, I don't plan on working on it on the actual page, but using a sandbox of some sort. Could you advise me as to both the feasibility of taking on such a project, as well as how to creat a draft like CoM's current Boothroyd article? Thanks, Unitanode 16:05""",0

"MSU Interview 

Dear Woohookitty,

My name is Jonathan Obar user:Jaobar, I'm a professor in the College of Communication Arts and Sciences at Michigan State University and a Teaching Fellow with the Wikimedia Foundation's Education Program. This semester I've been running a little experiment at MSU, a class where we teach students about becoming Wikipedia administrators. Not a lot is known about your community,  and our students (who are fascinated by wiki-culture by the way!) want to learn how you do what you do, and why you do it. A while back I proposed this idea (the class) to the community HERE, where it was met mainly with positive feedback. Anyhow, I'd like my students to speak with a few administrators to get a sense of admin experiences, training, motivations, likes, dislikes, etc. We were wondering if you'd be interested in speaking with one of our students.

So a few things about the interviews:
 Interviews will last between 15 and 30 minutes.
 Interviews can be conducted over skype (preferred), IRC or email. (You choose the form of communication based upon your comfort level, time, etc.)
 All interviews will be completely anonymous, meaning that you (real name and/or pseudonym) will never be identified in any of our materials, unless you give the interviewer permission to do so.
 All interviews will be completely voluntary. You are under no obligation to say yes to an interview, and can say no and stop or leave the interview at any time.
 The entire interview process is being overseen by MSU's institutional review board (ethics review). This means that all questions have been approved by the university and all students have been trained how to conduct interviews ethically and properly.

Bottom line is that we really need your help, and would really appreciate the opportunity to speak with you. If interested, please send me an email at obar@msu.edu (to maintain anonymity) and I will add your name to my offline contact list. If you feel comfortable doing so, you can post your name  instead.

If you have questions or concerns at any time, feel free to email me at obar@msu.edu. I will be more than happy to speak with you.

Thanks in advance for your help. We have a lot to learn from you.

Sincerely,

Jonathan Obar

It says in the article that half-saiyan's bodies are weaker than full saiyans, but as far as I can tell this is purely speculation. The fact that, during the final battle with Cell, Gohan was stronger than his father at a far younger age, shows that it's simply not true. Goten and Trunks were also both halfbreeds and, since they both acheived super saiyan at a young age, were both stronger then their fathers at the same age. Half-saiyans not being able to acheive Super Saiyan 3 is also pure speculation - since Goten, Gohan and Trunks all stopped training hard at the end of DBZ, logically they wouldn't have gotten there. In any case, Goku was the only case of SSJ3 to ever occur, so it's very fuzzy in the area. The real proof that it's wrong, however, is that Gotenks could go SSJ3. Though you could argue that the two 'saiyan halves' double over, making him pure saiyan, this wouldn't make sense from a genetic point of view. In other words, Gotenks was a half-saiyan and he went SSJ3, so there is no proof to say an unfused halfbreed couldn't achieve it if they became powerful enough.

All that works after the EMP are the video camera, the 2 vans, the ferry, and military equipment.
Electronics that are off at the detonation of an EMP are much less susceptible to damage, so it's presumable that the video camera was grabbed after the destruction started and turned on then.
The first van was fixed by Ray, and the second news van was far away from the EMP.
The ferry was also far away from the NY EMP.
Military equipment, whether it was near the EMP or not, are constructed to be much less vunerable to EMP's, so its understandable that they would work.

CONFLICT OF INTEREST & NEUTRAL POLICIES OF WIKIPEDIA

Dear Wikinews, Wikipedia  since “conflict of interest” “neutral” is an important subject since “conflict of interest” is being herald by wikinews / wikipedia staff and volunteers, including being used by wikipedia/wikinews administrators and editors with which to have an article /story be deleted, and is grounds for action against a contributor, then please immediately provide documentation that editors, administrators and people providing articles and information to wikipedia and wikinews have no conflict of interest to the articles and stories they create, edit, supervise and/or contribute.  For example, did any editor have sexual relationship with a porn star or purchase movies or magazines of a porn star whose bio is listed on wikipedia?   This is a conflict of interest.   Another example, does any administrator, editor or volunteer of Wikinews and Wikipedia including “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra”, “Chris Mann” and “Whoville” own Disney stock, have gone to any Disney theme park, watch Disney movies and/or buy Disney products?   Then “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” and all of these editors and administrators are in conflict of interest.  Does the people involved with the wikinews articles about fossilized fish found in Canada, or with scientific discoveries or with lawsuits, have any connection to these products, places or businesses?  Then this is a conflict of interest.  What kind of verification did Wikinews and Wikipedia use to determine that volunteers including “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” don’t sell Disney products and have no business with the Walt Disney Company and their affiliates?    As documented volunteers including “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” together claim “conflict of interest” and delete any contribution in regards to Pirates of the Caribbean for either wikinews or wikipedia, and control it by upholding double standards.  Thus first we must verify wikinews / wikipedia enforcement of their policy of “conflict of interest” and “neutral”.

Wikipedia and Wikinews editors don't follow Wikinews' own written polices... “Do you know of an issue that has been forgotten?”. Then you generate and justify reason after reason to state that the above article is not newsworthy, and that wiki does not write old news. You even say one thing, and then later change that to be different claims to justify deletion.   You keep throwing different claims at an article you have targeted because someone had shown the charges to be untrue.   Wikinews and Wikipedia continues to uphold double standards, and then make statements with which to justify it.  Incredible, you ignore any details provided to your counter your claims, and then accuse the person of not acknowledging your control and your new set of claims.  Are you aware that Wikinews editors and wikipedia are in conflict of interest as well?   They proven that they have a network of supporting friends, using double standards, without following Wikinews and wikipedia's own written polices, and such. 

Wikinews and wikipedia allows editors “fans” to be bias, controlling whatever they choose to write even placing things like porn stars penis size, (copies of that have been documented as well) and to write articles that are one sided, promotional and links to various sites that further promote their cause, yet the editors delete anything that is added that they don’t approve from other people, and then justify reason after reason, such as claiming other people as being a conflict of interest, not being neutral and such if they write or contribute.  It's against wikinews and wikipedia policies to simple delete """"when in doubt don't delete"""" and not to show respect when communicating.  Yet you simply deleted the entire talk and all related pages and justify various statements calling it whatever you want to get your friends to sign off on your control.  If you don’t abide by wikinews and wikipedia’s own written policies, then remove all of the polices and stop telling the public to follow standards which are double standards and more..  Does the owner of the company know you are doing stuff like this?  

PS: “Blackpearl14"""" Do you, your friends and family or any contributors, editors, administrators or Mr. Wales or their friends and family own stock within the Walt Disney Company?  The Walt Disney Company page is not neutral, it is a series of promotional pages including links to products and causes of the Walt Disney Company.   Many of the other statements on the Walt Disney Company page don’t follow your so-called neutral definition.  Following your own claim of “neutral”, the entire page would have to be deleted per your own standards.  Furthermore, the lawsuit sentence that was placed on it, was exactly as the other statements of “criticism” within the Walt Disney Company page, yet you claim it’s",0

Re: the """"KKK"""" connection.  

As I recall, Napier forms a rebel group known as the """"Soldiers of Liberty,"""" but to maintain their cover, they only speak the initials of the organization.  I don't recall if we're told the Amtorian word for """"soldier,"""" but we do know that in their universal language, plurals are formed by adding a prefix, either """"kloo-"""" or """"kl-"""" depending upon whether the root word begins with a consonant or a vowel.  We do learn that the Amtorian for """"of"""" is """"kum.""""  Therefore, """"liberty"""" must either be a plural concept, or must begin with a """"k"""" anyawy.  So, the group is named the """"Kl-something kum K-something,"""" initials K-K-K!  We're told that's spoken kung-kung-kung on Venus rather than kay-kay-kay, by the kay ... er, way.

Wait a minute, on this basis, wouldn't just about every Amtorian organization have at least two K's in their initials? Wouldn't the K-K-K get confused with the K-K-P and the K-K-S-K and all the others.?  Hell of a way to carry on covert operations.  Sounds like that Monty Python bit about the Judean People's Front versus the People's Front of Judea and the other splitters.  (""""What!  You're from the kung-kung-kung!  How dare you?""""  """"No, I said kung-kung-bung!"""")

Ergo, it would be pretty stupid to use actual initials given a language that uses kl- before every plural noun.  

Such a language ought to sound pretty awful, and to initiate choking in the speaker whenever a long passage is spoken, but never mind.  If a language expert like Tolkein had pulled something like this, you might infer a sinister motivation, but Burroughs never let logic get in the way of entertainment, and this served him and his readers quite well.

Napier smiles in amusement when his organization is rendered as K-K-K. Given my explanation, he should have laughed out loud.  That's hardly a political endorsement. Pursuing that track is S.O.L., and that ain't Soldiers of Liberty.   05:46, 3 August 2010 (UTC""",0

"""

Answer: Thank you. - The allegiance that I corrected it to was the 'British Empire', not the UK. The """"Allegiance"""" category in this section applies to Currie's military career, which his WW1 service was the centerpiece of. That conflict was a clash between the British Empire & the German Empire, not Canada vs Germany. Canada declared war on the German Empire in 1914 as a integral part of the British Empire which was threatened as a whole, not as an independent country in isolation. Currie in 1914 would have regarded himself as defending the British Empire, not Canada in isolation, which was under no individual threat from Germany in the least. 

I understand the enthusiasm for Canadian patriotism, but it doesn't really make historical sense to use allegiance to Canada in this context, & it's a mistake to take contemporary sentiments & backdate them onto the past like this, where sentiment was different in these matters.

It would make sense to put military allegiance to the British Empire with that symbol for Currie's martial career, & the Canuck Red Ensign  (great flag, which should be re-introduced today imo, by the way) next to his nationality or birthplace, but putting military allegiance to Canada in the context of WW1 doesn't make contemporary historical sense?

Edit that Sparked Controversy

There is no consensus for a reverted edit that I made in this article (hereafter the “reverted edit”).  Therefore, I have not changed this article unilaterally back to my previous version, because that would be against consensus.

This reverted edit was reverted by KillerChihuahua (KC) who not only disagreed with it, but also said (in her edit summary) that the edit was disruptive.  I disagree with KC that the edit should have been reverted, for reasons already explained above.  I also disagree with KC that this edit was disruptive, and I will now fully and carefully explain why, for the record. This edit that KC reverted was clearly not redundant to any previous edits made anywhere else at Wikipedia, and thus this edit was not made by me in bad faith as part of any disruptive “edit war”.

This discussion of RCOG’s position on “choice” started at the article on fetal pain, and I moved it here for valid reasons.  At the fetal pain article, KC wrote: """"Please provide a source that this government institution is 'pro-choice' - abortion is legal in the UK, and that the official govt. chartered college are to make that safe is NOT pro choice.""""   I therefore investigated and learned that RCOG is not a government institution, that most of their members live outside the UK, that its governing documents do not specifically limit its activities, that many of its members do not have medical degrees, et cetera.  So, I concluded that the best place to deal with all of this would be here at the article on the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.  Here at the RCOG article, I added quite a bit of info,    in addition to RCOG’s abortion stance. When I was at the fetal pain article and decided to move to this RCOG article, I repeatedly said so in the fetal pain discussion.   I did not sneak over here to try to avoid objections at the fetal pain article.

KC has elsewhere cited five diffs that she says prove this controversial edit was virtually the same as several contested assertions I had made previously. Here are KC’s five diffs: (1) in the fetal pain article, (2) in the fetal pain article, (3) in this RCOG article, (4) in this RCOG article, and (5) in this RCOG article.

None of these five previous edits cited by KC is the same (or virtually the same) as the reverted edit that sparked this controversy.  Both KC’s diff (1) and diff (2) show where I inserted a cite to support another editor’s assertion that RCOG is a “pro-choice group”.  KC pointed out very clearly at the fetal pain article that she did not think RCOG was a “pro-choice group” even though she thought RCOG could have a “pro-choice position” on particular issues:

There is no uncertainty or ambiguity that KC argued RCOG may have a pro-choice",0

edit conflictMy Dear (though Furioso) Orlando: In the first diff,  has left you a message about """"Masem’s talk.""""  In my world, a """"talk"""" is a public lecture, typically given at a conference, convention, or educational institution. As you may recall, I gave one of these at Southampton last month on a topic of mutual interest.  In light of that, and of Masem’s Signpost article, I supposed that   referred to something of a similar nature that Masem had delivered. Asking for the citation seemed that natural and polite thing to do. It turns out, Vordox meant """"Masem’s talk page""""; I've seldom seen that usage in Wikipedia or elsewhere.  I see Vordox is active on Twitter, where they have 129 tweets to their 3 followers and conversations with TotalBiscuit, Masem, CH Sommers,and SargonOfAkkad ; say hi for me!

In this particular response, I am pointing out that relaxed standards might have surprising effects, and I use the name of the predominant editor as a metonym for the argument. 

I might also mention that I myself have not complained  at least not publicly  of the numerous efforts that have been made to personalize the dispute on Gamergate's behalf, both on-wiki and off, including previous sections on this talk page, elsewhere on Wikipedia, and at 8chan and reddit and in press releases and correspondence.

 Hi . Wikipedia has a strict policy on how we write about living people. Wikipedia is one of the top 5 websites on the planet—if someone types anything in Google, Wikipedia will almost certainly be on the first page of results if we have an article about it. As a result, we have to pay special attention to living people. Anything we write about them can actually harm them in real life if it isn't backed up by high-quality reliable sources. In other words, we need to get the article right. And one important policy we have is that any poorly sourced negative information about living people should be removed. Next time, you need to back up your content with reliable sources—see Wikipedia:Citing sources and Wikipedia:Referencing for beginners for how to do this. We thank you for your interest in contributing to Wikipedia, however. Check out our introduction to editing for more information on how you can contribute constructively.   """,0

"Conferences are a problem I've been meaning to work on. There are only a very few conference series in the world for which there are truly substantial third party references, but there are many of great importance: the situation is similar to journals. In practice, tho we don't word it that way, the effective criterion for journals is that papers there are highly cited (as measured by the impact factor from  Journal Citation Reports). This can apply to conferences also. The difference is that for most conferences, the papers there are preliminary results and not rigorously peer reviewed & therefore  not highly cited as compared with journal papers by the same authors. There are two classes of exceptions: ones where the papers are major review articles in the field, and ones in engineering where they are the basic means of publication.  I'm not sure about this one. Ido not think it is  one of these exceptions, and I think the publications are mainly just abstracts, as is common with many conferences.  I would need to check, & I  cannot do it this week.  
But personally, I would include in WP articles about all journals used as references here, and all major conference series, however, I doubt this would have consensus.  The compromise solution is therefore to write the articles about the sponsoring society and have a section on the conference. That is probably the best thing to do here. 
The main thing I think we want to avoid is writing articles on individual conferences in a series. This would amount to our being a nonselective index or bibliography. '''''' ( talk )",0

Apparently it's you that needs to look more into the situation without making snap decisions.

There were no death threats at all on his page, and had he been more clear about what he was doing instead of being disruptive, this would have been resolved much more easily.

Response: The story is absolutely true. It happened on a Sunday; I believe the date was January 13, 2002 (absolutely certain of the weekend and year). I was physically in the building on the following Monday and Tuesday. Monday, tours of the building were canceled and access to many areas was restricted because several hallways were blocked off. Reputable source: That Tuesday's USA Today (1/15/2002?), print edition, page 3-A (as printed in the Washington DC market, at least), carried the story. It is no longer online (I looked). I may have saved the clipping, and if I can find it, will scan and post it.

Try |this link. I went to USA Today website, clicked on Site Map, then Archives, then entered """"Fox"""" (minus the quotes) in the Search box, and narrowed dates to 1/14/2002 to 1/18/2002. You will find the entry on the second screen. Headline: """"Sly intruder infiltrates Supreme Court"""".

I would appreciate your restoring my entry. Thank you.

"""It depends how you define """"World."""" The war which commenced in 1939 was only between European states, while the two most industrially powerful countries on the globe (USA and Soviet Union) were not at war. It only becomes an actual world war in 1941. It could be rationally argued that if the war had ended before 1941, before the USA and SU got involved, then it would just have been called the European War, or the Great Nazi War, or the Anglo-Franco-German War or something similar. It is difficult to see why a war which leaves out the two most powerful countries on Earth could in any real sense be called a """"world"""" war. (And I am writing this as a European.) Still, the war has to be called something, and once it became a world war in 1941 then the name could retrospectively be applied to the fighting which preceded it.

His baronetcy adds to that.,0

"99 out of 100 articles tagged within moments of creation would have been speedy delete candidates an hour later. It is that 100th article and its creator that not tagging hastily addresses most importantly. It also has a drama-reducing secondary effect even for some of the 99 because some, who would not have said anything when their non-notable subject is deleted when it can be assessed, will squawk if it's deleted before that assessment could have been made. In either case, we don't know what people will write until they write it. We do get valid COI vanity articles.

The example is a poor one, and should be removed from the article. The article states that it seems to require 5 colors, presumably because the grey area cannot simply be colored red, yellow or blue without re-coloring. However, it *can* be colored green, and that doesn't require shuffling any of the other colors around. This makes it a very misleading counterexample. I know I spent a lot of time scratching my head wondering why this was considered a counter-example at all, and how the caption made any sense. Please either replace it with an example which does need to be re-colored in order to work or remove it (not that I don't think it's a valiant attempt, but it's just confusing).

On other issues, I'd like to get more information or at least a good starting point of the the key points of both sides and places to looks further.  going on an issue-by-issue basis is OK but very time consuming. Also, you get a lot of misleading information by looking at sites that promote their point of view. it would be great if there was a web site that had already done this.  Like having an intelligent person research each issue and then give you a one-page summary like """" Here's the issue, here are the two or three main sides, here's the philisophical underpinning for each side, and here are the main points each side makes, backed up by these references.""""

Focus on Search Box When Main Page Loads
Is there any way someone can change the main page so that when it is first loaded, the insertion point is already blinking in the """"Search"""" box (like, for example, when you go to Google).  It would mean that the moment a person loaded the page, they could type what they're looking for.  It's an encyclopedia, so the search box should have a little more priority, don't you think?  The fact that it takes an extra click to get to the search box suggests that the main page is primarily a """"click-thru"""" page to other content.

He died of cancer, partially, it seems, due to his reluctance to take advange of Western medicine. Marley's article suggests that his birthday, not his deathday, is what is celebrated annually. Does Wikipedia do these anniversaries on round numbers like 25?   

Not usually. Maybe on the 100th anniversary of his death. Maybe. More likely not. —é ([[User",0

 UPDATE 

I don't have time for another long post, but I would like to share a site that you can use.  http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/shilohshepherd.htm

This site also includes 

ARBA = American Rare Breed Association
APRI = American Pet Registry Inc.
NKC = National Kennel Club

However, my research has proven that many other """"registries"""" are also selling papers for Shiloh Shepherds!!  These include, but are not limited to .....

Other All-Breed Registries: 

The following is a list of some of the other all-breed registries in existence in North America — Caution should be exercised when dealing with a breeder who registers with any of these registries, especially when the breed is recognized by any of the major all-breed registries listed above. Many breeders use these registries because they are not able to meet the more demanding requirements of the CKC, AKC, or UKC. 

The information shown in quotations was taken directly from the registry's web site and speaks for itself as to the goals of some of these registries. 

American Canine Association (ACA) — """"America's largest veterinary health tracking purebred canine registry."""" — Note: In the """"Find A Puppy"""" section of their website, dog/puppy seekers are referred to pet/retail stores. Very little information is available on the website regarding their goals or mission as a registry. 

American Purebred Registry (APR) — The APR issues registration certificates for dogs and cats. They start a pedigree file with the information the owner sends them. Once APR accepts an application, a registration certificate is issued and the animal is considered registered. APR is a record keeping agency only and does not sponsor dog shows, field trials or competitions of any kind. On the application, the owner certifies that the dog or cat is a purebred representative of the breed. They take the owner's word for it and no proof is required. 

America's Pet Registry Inc. (APRI) — """"An internationally recognized association of responsible pet owners, breeders, distributors, veterinarians, retailers, pet product manufacturers, and other concerned parties dedicated to the humane care of animals, the preservation of quality bloodlines, and the individual's right of pet ownership."""" APRI recently re-incorporated as a for-profit corporation. — The APRI promotes and encourages the sale of dogs and cats through distributors and retailers. """"America's Pet Registry, Inc. was begun as insurance for the pet industry..."""" """"APRI offers free dual registrations on dogs from reputable registration services to professional breeders. We classify a professional breeder as one who has three or more breeding females and who regularly sells puppies in the pet market."""" 

Animal Registry Unlimited (ARU) — Some statements found on the opening page of their website: """"We register all pets and animals."""" """"We guarantee that your pet or animal can be registered with us."""" """"Providing a registry for the development of new breeds of useful pets and animals. Unlike many organizations we encourage the development of new breeds."""" 

Continental Kennel Club (CKC) — Note: This registry is also known as the CKC and should not be confused with the Canadian Kennel Club — These are two completely separate registries.) — The Continental Kennel Club recognizes 450 breeds as purebred. The Continental Kennel Club has a section known as """"Miscellaneous Breed Registration"""" which allows for the crossing of two purebred parents of different breed types to produce hybrid puppies. Registered as MISC/BREED1-BREED2 and isolated from purebred registrations, they are distinguished from other breeds on registration certificates by having """"non-purebred"""" printed on their registration certificates. In addition, the Continental Kennel Club has a section within their club for developing new breeds. Stock used for these breeding programs is listed in the """"Development Class"""". The Continental Kennel Club has implemented a classified section on their site where club members can advertise their breeds. If you have a look at some of the more popular breeds such as the Cocker Spaniel, some of the kennels advertising there include breeders of cock-a-poos and other crosses. The Continental Kennel Club's website provides very little information regarding their goals or mission as a registry. For more information, however, there is a very thorough web page at: Continental Kennel Club FAQ.

Dog Registry of America (DRA) — (Formerly the US Kennel Club) Statements directly from the Registry's home page: """"DRA Registers rare breeds and exotic breeds.

"""No, what you've done is prove you're clueless.

1) DID YOU READ THE TAG THAT THE ADMINISTRATOR PUT AT THE TOP OF THE PAGE? OBJECTIONS ARE TO GO TO THE DISCUSSION PAGE WHILE THE PAGE IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION. STOP BEING A PEST. YOU'RE NOT HELPINGYOUR GRINDING YOUR PERSONAL AXE like an immature little child. And it's not ME you're embarrassing, IT'S YOURSELF.

2)  A few of the entries DO need citations, but links to other Wikipedia articles ARE the citations. Do you even remotely understand the concept of BRANCHING?

One of the reasons the article is being flagged for being too big is that people aren't BRANCHING to other links where there are CITATIONS supporting THOSE PARTICULAR POSITIONS. One DOESN'T HAVE TO RE-INVENT THE LIGHTBULB everytime one needs a new lightbulb.

2) I fixed the broken link. And if you had bothered to READ the sermon/discussion between Branham and Billy Gramham, you would have found in paragraph 40 this """"trinities"""" statement...

40 Jesus come three times. He came the first time to redeem His Church. He comes the second time to receive His Church. He comes the third time with His Church. EVERYTHING IN THE BIBLE TRAVELS IN TRINITIES, THREES, but all in one Christ. He... Remember, the first time to redeem His Church, the second time to receive His Church, the third time with His Church, as King and Queen.
Now, but on His first coming, we'll speak of just a little bit, and then on His being here; and then on His second coming; on Hisand then on the third time; if the Lord willing.

(And if I could figure out a way to link directly to that paragraph, I would.)

The problem with Branham's statement is that not every triunism is a """"trinity,"""" which is a confusion of terms.

Scholars ALSO use the term """"typology,"""" but usually only in twos.

I'll add more references from the THOUSANDS of them out there later.

3) You demonstrate your ignorance of the Bible and Jewish traditions: Citing that John said Jesus """"went up to the feast of the Dedication which is held in the winter,"""" i.e. HANUKKAH, is NOT """"original research."""" ANYONE WHO KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT THE BIBLE (which you don't) KNOWS that """"the feast of the dedication that is held in the winter IS HANUKKAH. And you DON'T NEED CITATIONS to CITE A STATEMENT OF FACT (especially when there is a link to the """"Hanukkah"""" page).

4) Citing that John spoke five kingdoms that """"were,"""" one that """"is,"""" etc. is ALSO A STATEMENT OF FACT. And the concept of TRIUNISM/TRINITIES/TYPOLOGY is ALL OVER CHRISTIAN LITERATURE.

"A typical anti-Ukrainian Russian imperialistic claim 

The current version of the introductory section contains at least one paragraph that is purported to make Ukraine look as a home of all sorts of people, except Ukrainians themselves. Here is what it says, as of today:

 Ethnic Ruthenians were frequently a rural people and often formed minorities in their own cities and towns. For example, Kiev in the 1920s was approximately 1/3 Jewish and 1/3 Russian, with the remaining third constituting ethnic Ukrainians, Poles, and Germans. A similar demographic history existed in Lviv with a majority Polish and Jewish population.

Am I the only Ukrainian editor who finds these kind of statements offensive? Not only these kinds of claims have absolutely no ground in the known Ukrainian historical facts, but they, in fact, repeat, almost word in word, the statements made by anti-Western anti-Ukrainian Putin propaganda!

I asked the editors to provide the citations justifying the obviously false claims in these paragraphs. My requests have been deleted and I has been told that they will block my Wikipedia account. 

 Pseudo-Western editors adding Russian propaganda to this article 
It looks to me that at least this Ukraine-related article has been monopolized by some editors who created Western-looking Wikipedia profiles. However, these editors keep censoring the article ad adding to it the statements coinciding with the Russian imperialistic anti-Western and anti-Ukrainian propaganda.

 European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) Decision On The 1915 Armenian Event

On 17 December 2013, (the case: Perinçek v. Switzerland (application no. 27510/08)) European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) punished Switzerland for criminally convicting Mr. Perinçek for publicly challenging the existence of the Armenian genocide. Perinçek said """"Armenian genocide is an international lie"""". ECHR punished Switzerland for violating Perinçek's right of freedom of expression (Article 10). ECHR referenced three decisions on its verdict: 
a. In November 2007, The Spanish Constitutional Court had found unconstitutional the offence of negation and had taken the view that
the mere negation of a crime of genocide did not constitute direct incitement to violence. 
b. In February 2012, the French Constitutional Council had declared unconstitutional a law which made it a criminal offence to deny the existence of the genocides recognised by the law, finding it to be incompatible with freedom of expression and freedom of research. 
c. The United Nations Human Rights Committee had expressed its conviction that “[l]aws that penalize[d] the expression of opinions about historical facts [were] incompatible with the obligations that the Covenant [on Civil and Political Rights] impose[d] on States parties ...” and that the “Covenant [did] not permit general prohibition of expressions of an erroneous opinion or an incorrect interpretation of past events”.ECHR ECHR punished Switzerland for criminally convicting Mr. Perinçek for publicly challenging the existence of the Armenian genocide (Perinçek said """"Armenian genocide is an international lie"""").

I hope now that the researchers can freely and without any fear research what happened in 1915.
Notice that in 2013 ALL Ottoman Empire archieves are open to the researchers and any researcher can freely read ALL the archieves and documents in Turkey.
However, Armenia still does not allow its archieves to be searched and reserached. 212.174.38.3

 Eastern Orthodox Church and other Eastern Churches 

I am not a writer or an editor, so I am not sure how to approach the correction of the page, nor am I a genealogist or a theologian, so I'm not really schooled in the subject matter, so I could be wrong about this.
  In the article under the heading of Eastern Orthodox Church and other Eastern Churches, it says """"However, in the Eastern Orthodox Church, marriages of affinity that produce children who are closer genetic relatives than legal are also not permitted (unless the genetic relationship does allow marriage between those children).  For example, two siblings may not marry two other siblings because legally their children will be cousins, but genetically they'll be half siblings.  On the other hand, two siblings may marry two cousins.""""
  Although I am not sure what the laws are in the EOC regarding marriage of first cousins, I believe the example given is in error.  Half siblings are children who share one parent, either the father or the mother.  I believe that their children would in fact be cousins in two lines.  However, according to the Wikipedia page on siblings, two of the siblings in the scenario were identical twins, this would in fact make their children genetically equivalent to half siblings, as well as cousins.
  As for the second example, of two siblings marrying two cousins, their children would be first cousins in one line, and second cousins in the other line.
  Again, I have never formally studied genealogy, and have no references, so don't take this as an affront, but I think I am correct.

Thank you.

I request that this article remove and correct this erroneous entry in order to be accurate and correct (an important and very valid Wikipedia motivation). Clinton's term began in 1993, this is two years after the end of the cold war. The George H.W.

There is however a """"Biblical canon"""" which includes a Jewish canon section. However there are rules on why some books are included in TaNaKh, and some are not. There is NO evidence in JEWISH sources that there EVER was a 'canon' in the Christian sense of the word. Most deduction is based on non-Jewish sources and modern academic research. Therefore you can not call TaNaKh a canon just so it can fall into the same definition as Christian works. This is particularly true since the TaNaKh is not consistently used by Christianity to 'rule' on issues of dogma, and the Christian canon is not used at all in Jewish halacha.""",0

Well, I left for two days anyway, and I see no reason to dredge up a closed thread.  

I will say that the whole point of the thread (as Calton indicated) was to not have to get involved in it myself, and there was also really no need for an IP which displayed disruptive behavior in the past to get involved.  IPs are nice to hide behind, and I will bet money on the fact that it's been the same person all along (which is where my remarks came from).  I'm happy to admit a mistake when I make one, but this was not a mistake.  I will stand behind everything I said, based on the following line of reasoning:  a static IP is often tied to the same computer in an office (MHEC, the IP location, is not a school, it's a governing authority for the state schools in Massachusetts, so it has an office and an .edu address, but not a campus of 50 million people using a computer in the library).  The chances of two different people on the same IP (meaning at the same computer) knowing enough of Wiki internals to: go poking around ANI, try to run for ArbCom, request a block for an admin, and then have troll unblock requests (""""hello"""" is not a spurious unblock request, really?), is just too small for my liking.  I'm sorry if I'm not going to AGF that, but I cannot suspend my disbelief that far, and I got hammered for it.

Now back to praising you: You could have simply done to me what too many other powerful Wikipedians do: with 2 clicks, undo the ~1 wo/man-week of work my friends and I invested into the Cooperation Index and 3d2do designs. Side note: we designed those mechanisms specifically for the inactive Community & Kindness projects that we adopted back in November. Our premise is this: systemic bias and other dysfunctions within the Wikipedia Community are but symptoms of diseases which have rendered our Community moribund for almost a decade. But we did agree that the Gender Gap among Wikipedians is the most shameful of these symptoms, so our first application of the Cooperative design is meant to end - and quickly - the gender bias among Wikipedians.

 also expressed some major concerns, in a note to me via the Gender Gap list.

That would do, why don't you go to every store that every chain has and figure the national average price on everything, then ignore the wages that their employees make (to be spent at the other business in town, maybe even funding your job), and draw up an addition to the article determining who benefits from shopping where. Let's say Company X has a store, with 500 jobs, paying $10 an hour, then Company W comes in,  adds 500 jobs, paying $6 an hour, drives Company X under, now the wages that Company W pays are the ones being spent in the area, guess everyone benefits from a 40% drop in the spending from 500 people's incomes.",0

"""::::::""""Forthcoming book

A trio of LDS scholars have been funded by the LDS church to write a book, Tragedy at Mountain Meadows, to be published by the Oxford University Press:

Ronald W. Walker (BYU Professor of History), 
Richard E. Turley Jr. (managing director of the Family and Church History Department of the Church), and Glen M. Leonard (director of the Church's Museum of Church History and Art). 

The three were granted access to documents in the LDS Church archives. According to Turley, a file in the archives confirms that Lee was acting on his own. The file included the notes of a Mormon historian who, at the request of Church leaders, conducted a confidential investigation of the massacre in 1892. Turley said, """"There are very candid statements on the part of participants to a Church official under the agreement of confidentiality.""""

While the trio found additional evidence of church leaders' culpability, Turley stated that """"Utahns elsewhere in the territory acted to preserve the lives of other troublesome immigrants . . . Unfortunately, the militia and church leaders of Iron County made different decisions, and their acts demand the strongest condemnation . . . Circumstance may explain their acts; nothing can justify them.""""

The new sources the co-authors are using will be made public once their book is published. Turley said although the church is cooperating and is funding the research, the work is """"not a Church commission""""; """"The idea to do the book was ours, not theirs."""" Publication apparently has been delayed as the co-authors have tried to be as thorough in their research as possible. According to Turley, LDS leaders share the authors' desire to bring all available evidence out in the open. First drafts of the book will be circulated for comment among LDS and non-LDS parties, including historians and descendants of the perpetrators and victims. """"Open, candid evaluation of that tragedy can produce catharsis, a cleansing spiritual renewal and healing,"""" Turley said, adding that the authors will """"present the evidence as we find it - honestly, openly and candidly.""""

The above is hardly an example of a brief description, and is far greater than the longest has ever been for the Franz books. I have put back a smaller concise, neutral description that should keep all happy. Posted Central 10 July 2005

 Angel 

Well, yeah I'm a bit miffed to be honest. It's okay. Buffy Season Eight is a barrel of godly goodness, and by comparison Angel feels like Amazons Attack. Characterizations are off, I'm afraid. Connor's introduction felt ... crappy. Wesley's been introduced in the wrong way - don't jump him into a new role and backtrack characterization, do a Giles where you see him maybe two panels at a time and flesh him out through his own internal monologue. Lynch is a Spike fan, and he's projecting weird lusty desires onto Spike (vicariously?) - although Spike's not above the occasional Buffybot, it seems so strange. Strangest of all is Illyria. I would imagine she would either be desolate and destructive, walking about town killing without rest, or in some way secluded and shattered. For some reason it reminds me of Marvel vs. DC, where writers decided """"why introduce them cleverly? just have them start wailing on each other!"""" I also am trying my hardest to like Urru's style, but personally I think Jeanty and Lee are so much better, the slightly cartoony style better captures the tone of the series. Perhaps somebody like Nicola Scott would have been a better choice for Angel (by bizarre coincidence, going on her page after recommending her, she's done Illyria comics for IDW before!).

I'd say a good quality of the series is Betta George. I think 12 issues may be too long if this is the pace Lynch is going to have, and I'd have liked to see another writer try the Fight Night double-issue. I hate these publisher-exclusive contracts - I wish Geoff Johns or somebody could give it a go. I feel the book needs more pace, and better humour. Fix those two things and the other faults will fizzle away.~Talk to me! """,0

"The fact that Azeris are mixed Turkic speaking people that sprung from the Turkish invasion points to the fact that they did not just appear.  They were and are in the location that was Arran that consistent of Albanians, and Iranian tribes.  Furthermore, the fact that the entire area was called Arran, then for some reason was renamed Azerbaijan is another indication that Azeris were not a Turkic speaking group that just living side by side in the Caucus next to the Sakas.  No one said Azeris in the north do not have differences when compared to other Iranians, in fact Iranians are a multi-ethnic, multi lingual group, much like the Kurds in the west have a different language/customs, as do Balochies in the south.  What happened to Iranians in Arran intermittingly, in which the Turks invaded their tribes, and the Albanians were driven out, and imposed their language on them via Elite Dominance, does not change their original ancestry.  You have again failed to give a single rationale as to where the Azeris came from, why they even appear/are part of Iran, even today, and why these ethnic groups even have a Persian culture?  In all, you can concentrate on their differences, but fail to explain where did Azeris come from?  It is astonishing how some choose to skip many important facts, and write pages of texts about Germanic peoples in an article about Iranian peoples.   I think I’ll stop at that.",0

After the Christian population of the bishoprics of Skopje and Ohrid voted in 1874 overwhelmingly in favour of joining the Exarchate (Skopje by 91%, Ohrid by 97%), the Bulgarian Exarchate became in control of the whole of Vardar and Pirin Macedonia. The Exarchate was also represented in the whole of southern Macedonia. The “Macedonian Question,” became especially prominent after the Balkan wars in 1912-1913 and the subsequent division of Macedonia between the three neighboring states, followed by tensions between them over possession of Macedonia. This partitioning of the territory had a tremendous influence on the development of the Macedonian national identity.Center for Documentation and Information on Minorities in Europe - Southeast Europe (CEDIME-SE)MINORITIES IN SOUTHEAST EUROPE - Macedonians of Bulgaria, pg. 6  In order to legitimise their claims, each of these countries tried to 'persuade' the population into allegiance. Paul Fouracre. Cambridge Encyclopedia of Medieval History Some scientists argue also that the use of any ethnic definition of the Slav speekers in Macedonia during the 19th and early 20th Century did not refer to ethnicity, but rather a socio-occupational description. The Slav population in Macedonia tended to be Christian peasents, farming folk,The Macedonian Conflict: Ethnic Nationalism in a Transnational World - Loring M. Danforth, ISBN13: 978-0-691-04356-2 attested socio-political circumstances, such as in what language the local schooling was provided, or whether the local church aligned itself with Serbian, Bulgarian or Greek Orthodoxy. The majority were under the influence of the Bulgarian Exarchate and its education system, thus in the early 20th century and beyond, were regarded as Bulgarians, whatever that meant.(Brubaker 1996: 153; Ruhl 1916: 6; Perry in Lorrabee 1994: 61)The 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica.

To Inquire into the causes and Conduct OF THE BALKAN WARS, PUBLISHED BY THE ENDOWMENT WASHINGTON, D.C. 1914  However, the key events in the formation of a distinctive Macedonian identity emerged during the first half of the 20th century in the aftermath of the Balkan Wars of 1912-1913 when the Bulgarian Exarchate discontinued its activity in most of the region. The process strengthed especially following the Second World War, with the withdrawal of Bulgarian authorities from Macedonia, the establishment of Yugoslav Macedonian Republic and the signing of Bled agreement. With the founding of the People's Republic of Macedonia in 1944 as part of SFRY, a sense of a Macedonian national identity gained strength and became systematised.(Bell 1998:193) The Yugoslav government began a policy of removing any Bulgarian influence and cementing the Macedonian identity.Europe since 1945.

Well then, (though I've not read it) I suspect Discover magazine is being silly. Rheumatic fever is one consequence of streptococcal pharyngitis. But another is renal failure causing nephrotic syndrome (and thus anasarca). So they can't really """"rule out"""" renal disease (nor can they with much legitimacy argue that Mozart """"probably"""" died of rheumatic fever because it was epidemic). Nor have they listed all the possible causes of anasarca. These """"retrospective"""" diagnoses are always rather tenuous, and should rarely be taken as proven. -  19:27, 5 Jul 2004 (UTC)""",0
"Armenian Genocide

""""""""the generally accepted cause of the death of Adolf Hitler,..."""" is not mentioned in two different versions of the article you and I were editing you put in """"The 1992 opening of records kept by the Soviet KGB and Russian FSB conflicted with the widely accepted version of Hitler's death as described by Hugh Trevor-Roper """" (my bolding) which replaced the former word confirmed. With an explanation on the talk page I changed it to """"largely confirmed"""". It is important to mention that most people thought Hitler had killed himself in the bunker long before the Russian archives were opened (for example The World at War episode """"21. Nemesis: Germany (February – May 1945)"""" and that events were reported in most English language histories as TR described them, and that his escape was by the middle 50's thought to be very unlikely by most people, although a favourite parlour game (which used to be included in this article) was to say """"if Hitler had survived he would be insert age"""". I added the sentence with cadaver to the article back in May 2006, one of the advantages of using the word cadaver was that as a summary of a source I used it removed any possibility that it was [[wp:plagiarism|plagiarism], and another advantage is it is accurate. However although I prefer the word cadaver in this sentence if there was a consensus to change it to corpse I would not object.

The improvement is obvious: I've cited the major literature  you can discover that it is the scholarly norm in religious studies by checking the various world-class peer reviewed journals I've already cited, along with the major publishers.

I didn't utter any threat to anybody and I have looked at this link of yours, stop making a fool of yourself by ignoring the facts. You pretend as if it was a threat but it wasn't.

I idn't receive any messages from you not even after you had banish me, yhought your message above is dated of the 26 of august it wasn't there at that date and I am sure of it. I didn't have acces to anything that day.
About the things I edit, they are of the most relevant kind to what is sayed ont this site.
All pseudo subbjects are all lies as the Bogdanovs have alredy answered all those points in different places of the web, inclusiv wiki, at different times, for the past 2 years.
For 13 days ago there was absolutely nothing more to discuss about, and seeing that, YBM used his ususal tactic who is to do as if they din't have answered the questions at hand, and that way, confuse the other users and make them believe that it was the case, as he has always done since 2003.
Someone has to stand up and say it, someone has to put an end to this circus, and I choose to do so.
I do not have followed the story from the beginning and do not know the Bogdanov but through this affair, that I begin to interest myself with since the beginning og august.
Two things became clear for me as I scanned all the web on the subjects: YBM was the person doing all the staging, and YBM didn't knew what he was talking about. I also found out that no matter how many times and in how many languages and by how many specialists the answers were given to him, he will keep asking and accusing peoples, and agress them personnally and accuse them of not being edicated in that field or critisized their university or making threat at contacting their chiefs, and even insult them to push them away from the discussion platform, as this kind of people represented a real threat to his status.
And of course, especially when we are talking of the scientific platform like in fr. physic or scent physic, those people, phd or professor at university were not used at being roll around with nor being talking to that way and even less at being insulted and confronted with non argumentativ methods.
So they left and never show up again, leeving all free room that YBM could ever wish for to pursue his goal.
But what was this goal exactly?
It wasn't the truth as he kept lying and had been given all answers, and was often denying to have done certain things who were appearing very often.
He was repeating himself and soon I saw a pattern emerging, from all his apparitions on the web, with falsh accusations, lies, home made stories, fantasyfull evidences, links to web sites from his own making, agression, personal attacs, insults.
His goal was not at all to discuss science but to manipulate others and he managed to do so very well as he was allowed to fool so many for such a long time. T>wo years is a very long time for a little subject as this one.
Then I was contacted by people who had been confronted to him, prior to this case, and had been subject to the same attacks and methods on the web.
I stude it, and saw worse than I could ever imagined. It was all planed from the beginning and a part of an ideologie with filosofical pretenses on how one could manipulate other people meaning by creating a situation on line.
It is what they call Post situationism, and wich is issued of Voyer. In the previous case against a teacher that he knew from school and a women writer (on cooking books!) he had just met Voyer but been found of him for a longer time, by the beginning of Bogdanovs affair he had been introduce inside the rangs of Voyer and Co, and as the affair progressed assured himself a high status in this """"confrerie"""".
That is the reason why this article I come with is of such importance. It reveal what was behind all along, what motivated the principal actors of this mascarade, and show all that they have been manipulated from the beginning and still are.
There is no Bogdanov affair, it is an illusion, a part from a group of ideologs making a thinking experiment and giving life to it by means of the internet.
Brillant! Unless there was casualties.
And there is.
Plenty of, and more than the Bogdanovs private sphere and their career.
I was really aroused from the beginning when I realised what YBM was about but even more when I saw what it all was really about, I was shocked by how unpropper and unethical it all was, and what a big unjustice it was to all who were involved in it, and this also include people who have followed and defended the apparent vews of YBM not kn",0
