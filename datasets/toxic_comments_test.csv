Well, this is definitely Start-class. The usual problems which Stub/Start articles have (fair use rationales, reference formatting etc) aren't there, which is great! Nevertheless, there's still some way to go to get this to B-class, but this can easily be attributed to the fact that the game's only been out for a week. Here are some ideas to improve the article:
You have some good screenshots, but one showing the actual gameplay (interface et al) would be useful.
The gameplay will be largely the same as EQ2, but it's still a good idea to include a brief overview and a link to EverQuest II#Gameplay. Information on new features could also be merged to this section.
Try converting the list of zones to paragraphed text, which is nicer to read.
To make the article easier to navigate, you might want to rename the History of Kunark section to Story and include any other plot details.
Lead needs expansion per WP:LS: summarise the entire article in three or four paragraphs.
Any information on the development of the expansion? When was it announced? Was it on show at any big game shows? Were there any slippages in release dates?
When enough reviews of the game have been released, create a Critical Reception section.
For ideas on the last two points, have a look at some articles at WP:VG#Featured content. Don't hesitate to ask if you have any further questions. Hope this helps, Talk",0

You are spot on Leladax. Some with a strong FYROM POV around here argue that 'Republic of Macedonia' is the only official name in use and wish to lock it in at Wikipedia.

While true many nations and NGO's have chosen in the interim to use """"Republic of Macedonia""""... all nations in principle agree to honour whatever name FYROM/Greece can hammer out. When it comes to Wikipedia itself all names should be used if NPOV was actually being observed... especially since the dispute is still ongoing.  Many countries around the world still officially use FYROM (including even the US which still uses both names at times (the US Senate resolution last year condemning FYROM actually used the FYROM name).

What I really think is missing from the article is that technically speaking FYROM is currently in breach of at least a few of its original UN brokered terms with Greece. (This incidentally is exactly why I the why the US government passed the resolution last year condemning FYROM for breaking terms,  why the Greek government vetoed FYROM's  recent attempt at NATO membership, , and why it will probably veto EU membership as well.)

Agreement Violation #1: FYROM was supposed to stick to FYROM for external use

FYROM citizens are now trying to be recognized exclusively as """"Republic of Macedonia"""" even though in Article 7 of the original UN brokered agreement (which their own leaders signed) specifically states

""""the Party of the First Part reserves the right to object to any membership referred to above if and to the extent of the Party of the Second Part is to be referred to in such organization or institution differently than in paragraph 2 of the United Nations Security Council resolution 817 (1993). (which is still be FYROM I believe)

Agreement Violation #2:: Refrain from propaganda against Greek cultural heritage and territory

Article 7 and 11 of the UN agreement between Greece and FYROM state:.

""""Each Party shall promptly take effective measures to prohibit hostile activities or propaganda by State-controlled agencies and to discourage acts by private entities likely to incite violence, hatred or hostility against each other.

If either Party believes one or more symbols constituting part of its historic or cultural patrimony is being used by the other Party, it shall bring such alleged use to the attention of the other Party, and the other Party shall take appropriate corrective action or indicate why it does not consider it necessary to do so.

The article should probably include a few real world examples to show the complaints are very real. I myself recently heard someone from FYROM claim Aristotle was actually Slavic on a forum but there are literally thousands of examples of irredentist behavior to be found. (a small subset of some recent examples that seemed relevant, verifiable and seemingly demonstrate the argument beyond the abstract) 

There exists a steady stream of FYROM supporters on the Alexander_the_Great article history page claiming Alexander wasn't Greek.  

Top ranked FYROM websites  almost universally are writing revisionist histories that suggest Alexander was not Greek  (quote taken from the website)
""""Contrary to modern Greek claims, Macedonia was never part of Greece, and the ancient Macedonians were not regarded as ancient Greeks.""""

Current FYROM Prime Minister welcomes Pakistan “Macedonian” Prince Ghazanfar  and uses it as """"proof"""" of their ancient Macedonian roots. That one really made me cringe considering not so long ago everyone was being assured by FYROM leadership...

'""""We are Slavs, who came to the region in the sixth century. We are not descendants of the ancient Macedonians.""""' Kiro Gligorov (FYROM's first President)

'""""We are not related to the northern Greeks who produced leaders like Philip and Alexander the Great. We are a Slav people and our language is closely related to Bulgarian... There is some confusion about the identity of the people of our country""""'. Gyordan Veselinov  (Canadian ambassador to Canada in interview to Ottawa Citizen in 1999)

(incidentally both quotes appear extremely relevant to the article. I tried to add them myself to the article but they were removed without justification. You are welcome to try.)

 defaultsort is your friend! 

Hello! I noticed your edit to Mikael Odenberg, so I thought I should drop by and tell you about the wonders of {{DEFAULTSORT}}.

A sortkey is an alternative term the article should be sorted by when listed in a category. For example to add an article called Albert Einstein to the category """"people"""" and have the article sorted by """"Einstein, Albert"""". You would type """"[[Category:People|Einstein, Albert]]"""". This kind of sortkey you successfully added to Mikael Odenberg in your edit.

But, I reverted most of your edit! Why? Because there is a feature called """"Default sort key"""", which changes the default sort key used by categories from the name of the article to the one specified with the magic word {{DEFAULTSORT}}. Instead of adding |Odenberg, Mikael you simply add  {{DEFAULTSORT:Odenberg, Mikael}} above the categories, which I had already done in this case.

Thank you for your otherwise very valuable contribution!  (Talk ° contribs)

 Chemsitry Comments 
I have noticed that you seem to spend a lot of time commenting on chemistry articles, claiming that they need to be either put in context or wikified. I was wondering if you could put in context your own level of knowledge in chemistry, so that the articles can be reeditted to be applicable to your own level of knowledge. With the chemical reaction stubs, I have been assuming that people will generally be looking at them  if they have a basic level of chemical knowledge (i.e. one of about an A-Level student in England) and will not need a full explanation of why the reaction proceeds as it does. If this does not fulfil your ideals what else will I need to add, complete mechanisms with comments of facial and stereo selectivities and such. If so this is simply not possible as there will be a large amount of repeated information on Wikipedia. Please get back to me on this topic. - 

Hello! Eh. Lately I've indeed been editing chemistry articles; BUT only to remove improper categories (such as those you added to, well, a damn lot of articles). Using AutoWikiBrowser. On some, tags such as {{wikify}} have been posted, but not many. I may have edited one or two chemical reaction stubs, but I don't know which ones. Point out more specifically which articles you refer to and I'll see what I can do. Do note, however, that my knowledge of chemistry is extremely basic, and my contributions to chemistry articles have only been clean-up/maintenance work.  (Talk ° contribs) 

Its okay. I'm a qualified chemist, but you seem to be suggesting for example on the Bechamp Reaction that more detail is needed. To me it seems clear. Also on the category front, they were not incorrectly labelled. I have been putting them into the topmost category they can go into so as to create a list of all the chemists that appear on wikipedia. This is because it is otherwise hard to see who may or may not need to be added. I have been finding your editting very unhelpful in removing them from this category.

What I appreciate about this discussion, is that it is being conducted by people who demonstrate a great deal of concern for the issues involved - both the subtleties and the sweep of the issue. I believe this is appropriate (though admittedly tiring) because, in legal matters, a great deal often hinges on a comma, or the inclusion/exclusion of the word """"not,"""" or other such maddening technicalities. Ergo Shakespeare's famous dictum about lawyers.

Consejo de Salud Playa de Ponce v. Rullan does provide federal precedent, and a framework for discussion and debate. However the Rullan ruling is not ultimately dispositive of a U.S. constitutional question or territorial status issue, since the U.S. Supreme Court is the court of ultimate (and binding) jurisdiction in both of these areas.

The language of the Rullan ruling did not grant full constitutional privileges to Puerto Ricans living on the island itself (as opposed to those living on the mainland). The Rullan court stated that """"Congress today, thus, must afford Puerto Rico and the 4,000,000 United States citizens residing therein all constitutional guarantees.""""

However, as stated earlier, Puerto Rico is subject to the U.S. Congress' plenary powers under the territorial clause of Article IV, sec. 3, of the U.S. Constitution.U.S. Const. art. IV, § 3, cl. 2 (""""The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States ...""""). 

The Rullan ruling occurred in 2008. Three years later (in 2011), insular Puerto Ricans have neither U.S. Congresspersons nor U.S. Senators, and they cannot vote for a U.S. president. Therefore insular Puerto Ricans are not fully-enfranchised U.S. citizens, and they have not been extended """"enjoyment of all rights and obligations under the U.S. Constitution.""""

It is thus clear that (in the exercise of its plenary powers) the U.S. Congress has chosen to ignore the Rullan ruling.
 
The operative word in this discussion (and I understand the frustration on both sides) is the usage of the word """"must"""" in the Rullan ruling. As forceful as that word sounds, it was mis-used by the Rullan court, because the U.S. Congress clearly ignored it.  

Again...a lower federal court is not the court of ultimate jurisdiction for the issues addressed by Rullan. The U.S. Congress ignored it. Puerto Ricans (on the island) are not fully-enfranchised, and therefore do not have """"enjoyment of all rights and obligations under the U.S. Constitution.""""

I hope this helps your process of consensus. I provided it in that spirit.  """,0
"""

The only """"major controversy"""" is that on this Wikipedia page, the denialists, such as Duesberg and his followers, those whose ramblings are linked out to from this page, and who have had their long-disputed and dismissed theories and misinformation floating around on he web for many years, were being used as the sole source of 'credible' information on the larger controversy around AIDS and poppers  until I happened upon it.  From the first edit I made, I was almost immeditely reversed, and edited.  Within hours of that first contribution, I was being threatened and censored.  Ultimately, I was blocked, charged with violating unknown-to-me 'rules' of Wikipedia, and otherwise censored, and rendered unable to contribute.  And, that, gentlemen, is what I've been complaining about for the past month here on Wikipedia.

It would be much better if the Wikipedians, with their vast experience of computer knowledge, particularly as it relates to being able to master Wikipedia, would stand aside and let those of us who actually have knowledge about the subject of nitrites and poppers make meaningful contributions to this page.

However, I suspect that will not be allowed to happen.  I say this based on my personal experience over the past month here, and based on the news accounts last month on CNN, ABC Nightly News, and elsewhere, which revealed that Wikipedia was being ruined by those who practice the same kind of censorhip and harrassment that I've been subjected to.

 Your edits to Robert Byrd 

I had to revert your edits to the above article for a number of reasons. First of all, articles must conform to WP:NPOV and be writted from a neutral point of view. This applies to critics of his record and supporters that seek to apologize for his past actions. As per Wikipedia policy, the burdern of proof would be on Byrd's critics, and not the senator, regarding whether or not he is still involved in the Klan. Any such implication without a source that he is still a member would, therefore, violate WP:V. Also, the placing of the comment in the first paragraph would violate WP:LEAD. 

Furthermore, the part about Marshall and Thomas is in fact in the article, as (regardless of what his backers may feel) pertinent to his record and is written according to WP policy. While the comments about the other nominees are arguable, you could, if well-sourced (which wouldn't be hard to do), find a quote from respected conservative civil rights activist Niger Innis that called his opposition to Rice and others """"racist"""". You could say something like """"His opposition to (whoever) was Labled as racist by Niger Innis, a spokeperson for CORE.""""

 Quick Question on Sephardic Jews...

I recently saw a documentary which claimed that Sephardic jews originated from a tribe in a land adjacent to israel (in the north, though i forgot its ancient name). The king/leader of this tribe was deeply impressed with his jewish neighbours and converted himself, as well as all his people, to judaism...

""":Except for the fact that Iraq did not have weaponized anthrax. Remember the WMD debacle? Weaponized anthrax is considered by all to be a WMD. Iraq's process, from research only, was also substantially different. So, either the administration DID find WMD's in Iraq and chose to instead embarrass the nation by denying them AND cover up an Iraqi WMD attack upon the US, which would be a clear cut act of war or the conspiracy theory is wrong. The """"makes sense"""" part then yields to Occam's razor, the conspiracy theory would have to be that the US choose to loose standing and face international criticism over invading Iraq and finding no WMD's AND pass up the opportunity to declare war on Iraq for a WMD attack OR the anthrax was NOT weaponized by Iraq, as it was coated and prepared differently than the Iraqi anthrax weaponization program did, but prepared in a way researched and used in past US programs. In short, the conspiracy theory fails on any examination of the facts as known.

The article looks well on its way now, but yes, I'll certainly be supporting in a day or two. I just want to read it through again to see if anything leaps out at me.

I'll mention one thing that's niggled at me for a while, which is if it's possible to be, as it were, more precise about the ambiguities of the Band-only tracks in the lead text of the Columbia Records compilation section. For instance, it states, """"According to Fraboni, four new songs by the Band were also recorded in preparation for the album's official release, one of which, a cover of Chuck Berry's 'Going Back to Memphis', did not end up being included."""" I wonder if something like this should be added: """"However, there is no scholarly consensus that the three songs on the album Fraboni says were recorded in 1975—""""Bessie Smith"""", """"Ain't No More Cane"""" and """"Don't Ya Tell Henry""""—were, in fact, recorded then."""" (On the other hand, it seems far more likely to me that Fraboni/Griffin is right than Bowman, so I dunno...)—  """,0

"WCW International Title

They credit him with 14 WCW World titles (obviously considering his NWA World Titles as WCW tites), 2 WWE Titles, and 2 WCW International titles.

They recognize him as 16-time World Champion - do the math  14 + 2 + 2 = 18...guess what 2 titles are left out in the cold (hint - it ain't his 2 WWE Titles).

The problem being, my friend, that you are not a specialist in that field, and have been posting for over a month in YBM's private forums, and are a very big fan and socket puppet of his.
The second problem being that your extensiv scientifical """"evidencies"""", well supplied above, contain absolutly nothing who don't have been mentioned, and I should say """"supposed"""", earlier, already at the beginning of 2004, and abundently refutated since, and that all those counterproofs dismantled all the attacks from the scientifical part of the accusators, and that it was then agreed that it was more a question of specialisation differences than of direct misunderstanding of existing theories, or gross ignorancies of basic physic.
Thats what make Cosmology a specific part of advance physic.
Your field being not Cosmology nor Higher physic nor Theoretical Physic, it will have been better if you had first consulted with a """"collegue"""" from the department of Theoretic Physic, before you posted here, or even before you made up your opinion about the Bogdanovs work.
You made already plenty of that kind of mistakes also in the french wiki about this case, and no, we are not impress at your ability to repeat yourself and others statements without correction alredy brought by other scientifics.

I would suggest this as the first paragraph:

Antisemitism (also spelled anti-semitism or anti-Semitism) is prejudice against or hostility towards Jews. [Semites]] include other than Jews, but the correct use of the term since its inception has involved applicability to Jews only. Thus the term antisemitism is used only to refer to hatred of Jews; it is never used when making reference to other groups of people who might be called """"Semitic."""" The term can be spelled in the hyphenated form both with """"Semitism"""" capitalized or in lower case, but in this article an editorial decision has been made to use the unhyphenated form of the term throughout. 

I have also left off the last sentence:

""""In its extreme form, it """"attributes to the Jews an exceptional position among all other civilisations, defames them as an inferior group and denies their being part of the nation[s]"""" in which they reside.""""

Why have you changed the image again? The text is now all but unreadable. It is now forced into single-word lines, extending down past the reference section. ,It looks ridiculous. You quoted IMGSIZE, yet again, in the summary. That policy states:
 In general, do not use px without very good reason

What that means is, the policy needs not to be unilaterally enforced at all costs. If, as in this instance, there is a need for a change in size, it is permissible. The policy further states:
Where px is used, the resulting image should be no more than 500 pixels tall and no more than 400 pixels wide, for comfortable display on the smallest devices in common use.

I have already (and repeatedly) demonstrated that upsizing to 250px is all that required. (I bet even 220px would work). That is well within the limits. The change to the picture itself is negligible, and therefore does not impact the article negatively in any way. It only servers to benefit the article by making the text within the caption more wieldy and easier to read. It also eliminates the impact of needlessly extending the picture frame all the way down to the refs.

Surely you can see this. Since you're quoting this policy so much, surely you know that it does not prohibit this edit. I have asked repeatedly that you look at the effect on the article, both before and after the edit, and in doing so,. surely you see the need for this edit.

 crosstheTs is back 

Futper, as promised, I've been working on a precise report on your editing habits (and have assembled a long record of diffs that seem to show you almost without fail push FYROM positions (highly improbable if you had a NPOV on the issue) I have also been reading up on Wikipedia's Administrator_Code_of_Conduct.

""""Admins are entrusted with additional abilities, but do not have special rights beyond those of regular editors. Like everybody else, admins are expected to behave in a civil manner.

Admins should also be aware that warning a user of a block, especially when the user has no prior history of problems, can be perceived as a threat. When dealing with otherwise good contributors, it may be advisable to make suggestions to their behavior without mentioning a block.

Reflecting on those words... I don't believe some of your intial words to me (which included ad hominem attacks me and threats to block me remotely match those standards).

""""Every sane person with normal adult intelligence can see that your allegations against B.F. are nonsensical. If you can't see that yourself, it's probably no use me trying to explain it to you. I will simply block you if you continue with this topic, for being either a malicious troll or too clueless for rational discussion""""

Also... I don't believe it was appropriate after I had made the initial anon complaint about you for you to block me (if you felt it was necessary it should have been left in the hands of another admin). The Wikipedia admin code of conduct clearly states this about admin conflicts of interests.

""""An admin should not block a user if they are not neutral with respect to that user, or have a conflict of interest""""

The reason why I'm asking is because I realize we both have strong POV on FYROM issues and that we got off on the wrong foot because of it. While I am preparing to push forward with a precisely itemized complaint against you (which I believe clearly shows inappropriate behavior towards me) I really don't want to go about this the long nasty way (which was why as a newb my complaint was anon until Beam started to unilaterally campaign to block me and reveal details) 

I would much prefer to save both our time by letting the matter drop but that would require your participation and assurance you will never again try to leverage your admin status as a tool to personally threaten me again. (surely others admins can handle it if it seems very necessarily to them) 

So what I really am asking here is are you willing to press the polite reset button and just stick to arguing points?   """,0

"""Once again you are selective in your responses and totally ignore important issues. for example:

You also say that the Rin tin tin Museum was """"short lived"""" and make not reference as to where this information is substantiated and yet the Museum still exists today.

You also say that Jannettia Brodsgaaard Propps amassed a collection of memorabilia which she did not. She never collected Anything. It was Edythe Shepard of Tucson, Arizona who collected a large part of the pieces in the museum and donated them to Rin tin tin.

There are other issues with other pages such as the Lassie page - you apparently did not follow the """"conflict"""" rules with them (Carol, Joan and Chelsea - yes they are friends of ours and in fact have one of our dogs)and allowed their """"version"""" of facts that surrounded the events associated with Weatherwax. Yet you will not make corrections to things in the Rin Tin Tin article that are incorrect and that are not as self-serving as the statements in the Lassie article. Honestly it appears that you do maintain a double standard.

I now see that you have arbitrarily added that a dog name Rin Tin Tin Smith attended the American Humane hero Dog Award Show in 2011 - there is no dog registered as Rin tin tin Smith and there has never been a dog called Rin Tin tin Smith. Not sure where you got your information but that too is incorrect. The call name of the dog is indeed """"Smith"""" but that is not his registered name. He is Rin Tin tin XII. We would still like to know who gave you this bogus information and it should be corrected. 

And again regarding Finding Rin Tin tin - if you have Tierney on one page should he not also be on the Finding Rin tin tin page and shouldn't you put Danny Lerner on the Rin Tin tin page.? I am sure Danny Lerner would appreciate that. If you would like a copy of the contract between First Look and Tierney we can certainly provide that to you. It specifically outlines Tierney's involvement as being only limited to a """"mention."""" He had no direct involvment in the """"making"""" of the film.

I would hope that you would research further to substantiate the 48 puppy issue. Your argument is that because someone """"mentions"""" it is a book that it is absolutely true. If that is the case then why do you discount other authors, books and writings?  You defend Orlean's writings as though they were your own and discount anyone else's, including English. That is surely a double standard and certainly NOT professional in any manner.

We would hope that your goal would be to provide correct information to people and to do it in a consistent manner. Apparently that is not your goal as evidenced by your self righteous indignation. In a lawsuit you could be described as having unclean hands. Shame on you.

Topical or thematic sections are frequently superior to sections devoted to criticism"""" and """"Sections or article titles should generally not include the word 'controversies'.""""

This article shouldn't have a standalone """"Controversies"""" section; controversies should be discussed in context in the """"History"""" section if they're important to the history of the university.

There is a longer article at History of the University of California, Santa Barbara with more room for detail.

 Bewilderland 

The introduction includes the comment:-
""""The story is told in the form of an episodic quest, and most chapters introduce a specific creature, or type of creature, of Tolkien's Wilderland"""".

I edited the last bit to Middle-earth because:-
(1) the introduction to creatures begins with Chapter 1, which introduces Hobbits (and Wizards and Dwarves), and continues with chapter 2 (which introduces Trolls) and chapter 3 (which introduces Elves). These creatures are not limited to """"Tolkien's Wilderland"""", and in fact the individuals introduced (Bilbo, Gandalf, Thorin & Co., etc.) do NOT live in Wilderland. Wilderland is properly the region east of the Misty Mountains, and Bilbo does not reach it until chapter 6.
(2) Furthermore, many of the creatures first encountered in Wilderland (e.g. Men and Dragons) are not unique to Wilderland in Tolkien's Middle-earth.
(3) I'm aware that Middle-earth in not named in the book. However most readers of Wikipedia would have heard of Middle-earth, and few would have heard of Wilderland.

 Edits proposed to plot description 

""""“Joliet” Jake Blues is released from the Joliet Correctional Center after serving three years of a prison sentence after being convicted of armed robbery.""""

Entry for Joliet Correctional Center.

""""Jake is irritated at being picked up by his brother Elwood in a battered former Mt. Prospect, Illinois police car, instead of the Cadillac The Blues Brothers used to own.""""

It's unclear here, however the Caddy Jake refers to may be Murph and the Magictones' pink vehicle first seen in the """"Howard Johnson's"""" scene where Jake and Elwood phone Maury Sline and are blasted the flame-throwing mystery woman. 

The Blues Brothers visit their childhood home, a Roman Catholic orphanage, Saint Helen-of-the-Blessed-Shroud Orphanage. From Sister Mary Stigmata (Kathleen Freeman), The Blues Brothers learn that a property tax lien on the orphanage property will be foreclosed upon unless five thousand dollars in property taxes is remitted on its behalf to the county (the associated church has elected instead to sell the building to the Board of Education rather than pay the tax assessment).

Part of the film's humour is the actual name of the orphanage. Credit to Kathleen Freeman. People erroneously thing charities and churches are completely tax-exempt; however the exemption most notably only extends to Federal income taxes. The property tax bill would probably have remained an unforeclosed lien had the church not decided to sell voluntarily to the Board of Education.

""""At the advice of their childhood mentor, Curtis (Cab Calloway), The Blues Brothers attend an evangelical church service at Triple Rock Baptist Church, led by the Reverend Cleophus James (James Brown), where Jake has an epiphany: The Blues Brothers can legitimately raise the funds by re-forming their rhythm and blues band, The Blues Brothers’ Show Band and Revue.""""

Credit to Cab Calloway and James Brown.
  
""""As The Blues Brothers drive past a doughnut shop and Nelson Funeral Home in the Bluesmobile, Elwood’s driving alerts two Illinois State Police troopers, Trooper Daniel (Armand Cerami) and Trooper Mount (Steven Williams), who, after pursuing The Blues Brothers into a quiet, secluded residential area, learn from their in-car SCMODS (State-County-Municipal Offender Data System) computer terminal of Elwood’s suspended driver's license. When Trooper Daniel and Trooper Mount attempt to place Elwood under arrest, Elwood speeds off, escaping by driving and crashing through, with the Illinois State Troopers in pursuit, the Dixie Square Mall.""""

Entry for Bluesmobile; since location in Chicago and Illinois is obviously a major plot element, reference that the particular law-enforcement agency here is the ISP; SCMODS article already exists, with explanation of the meaning, in this context; article exists for Dixie Square Mall. 

""""After parking the Bluesmobile in an alley-end compartment next to a high-voltage transformer (hence the Bluesmobile’s remarkable magical abilities) and arriving at Elwood’s home, a hotel for transients, The Blues Brothers are mysteriously unharmed from a bazooka attack launched by a mystery woman (Carrie Fisher).""""

Credit cast member Carrie Fisher; this scene is cut from many televised versions, DVD featurette commentary explains that Canadian actor Aykroyd felt this scene explained the Bluesmobile's magical abilities, yet director Landis felt this was not transparent.

""""The next morning, just as the Illinois State Troopers who attempted to arrest Elwood the previous evening, with the help of Parole officer Burton Mercer (John Candy) as to the true address of “the elegant abode of one Elwood Blues” (because Elwood had ‘falsified his renewal’ and ‘put down ten sixty West Addison’, the street address of Wrigley Field) attempt to serve an arrest warrant at Elwood’s tiny room. The mystery woman detonates a bomb that demolishes the building, which inadvertently saves The Blue Brothers from another attempted arrest.""""

Candy's character was important because he assisted in locating Elwood's abode; the 'Wrigley Field bit' is important plot-element humor.

""""Elwood proceeds to his “straight job”, on the assembly line at an aerosol-can manufacturer, takes several cans from the line and places them in his briefcase, and visits the plant manager, quitting his job, citing a decision to become a priest (curiously, Elwood’s supervisor’s office is adorned with a U.S. flag and an Illinois state flag, suggesting that the aerosol-can manufacturer in an enterprise owned by the government of the State of Illinois—or else simply that Elwood’s supervisor thought it would be cool to adorn his office with",0

Yes, it could do with more hands, and if you would like to help raise standards that would be great. I estimate that FAR has a lag of about 18-24 months on the average FAC in terms of difficulty. At the moment most FARs are of 2005/06 and earlier articles or aritlces from early 2007 that were lucky to pass and most are just kept if they are moved to mid/late-2007 standard. That's how I rate them anyway. There is hardly any 1a checking in there for one thing. ''''  (cricket calendar poll!'') """,0

 Strange edit 

Can you explain this edit? It seems to me to replace perfectly good punctuation with strange punctuation that makes nonsense of the sentence. Have I misunderstood? I don't understand the edit summary comment about """"reject[ing] the Wikipedia ethos"""", but whatever you think of an editor, that does not justify reverting a perfectly constructive edit.   
I have no problem with the commasbut the previous """"edit summary"""" was obscene and disgusting and degrading to Wikipedia and could not be allowed to stand.  
I agree that the edit summary was unhelpful (though """"obscene and disgusting and degrading"""" seems somewhat of an overstatement). However, to revert a good edit because you don't like the accompanying edit summary makes no sense, and besides, the edit summary still does stand, as reverting the edit does not remove the edit summary.   
the statement I consider obscene, disgusting and degrading was """"who wrote this originally? an illiterate american(did I just repeat myself), or a fucking 2 year old?)"""". That bespeaks an editor who does not respect the Wikipedia ethosand a """"comma fanatic"""" willing to make such outrageous statements over a trivial comma issue.   
The comma in question does seem to have affected the meaning of the sentence—it is not the sort of """"take it or leave it"""" comma which only a comma fanatic would insist on. We may therefore be dealing with some sort of all-purpose grammar fanatic, who threatens myriad rude improvements. Only time will tell.   
OK, Rjensen, thanks for pointing that out. I had assumed that you were referring to the edit summary in the edit that you reverted in the edit I linked to.

 Fred Meyer: Reversion 

I was asked to explain my reversion of your addition to the Fred Meyer article. That addition was composed of four parts. 
First, you claimed Fred G. Meyer to be a member of the Rosicrucian Order etc., providing sources. I won't discuss the validity of the sources here, but that clearly concerns Fred G. Meyer himself, not the stores, unless you can provide a source that states his business was influenced by his philosophical leanings. 
Next, you elaborated on the rosicrucian connection to Hitler. As far as I can see, the main connection to Fred Meyer was that both Nazism and the stores use the colours red, white and black, which is a rather weak link. No source was provided that the store logo may have been influenced by its Founder's rosicrucian connections. Hitler's connection to the rosicrucians was sourced (again I won't discuss the quality of the sources), but was unrelated to the stores. 
Thirdly, you claimed that the layout of racks gives a swastika and that green freight carts are nicknamed """"U-Boats"""", but this, the part most relevant for the stores, was still unsourced. 
Finally, the """"Notes"""" part could have been more fitting for the talk page, but definitely does not belong into the article proper.
Thus, your additions were either unrelated to the stores or unsourced. By the way, the version where you described your addition as """"your research"""" shows another problem: Even if it is true, original research is in principle unsuited for Wikipedia. I hope that answers your question. Yours,  """,0

"""lol. Regardless of intent or accident - I actually wish that GoingBatty would listen to my request and avoid pages that I'm working on. GoingBatty was (and still is) not interested in  Brazilian Hip Hop unless he's a secret gangster rapper. Maybe after a hard day in the hood with his scout charges this scoutmaster relaxes by expressing himself through rap. Anyway I'm bored by him and a whole bunch of other editors - all of whom seem to be here either as incognito moralists, conservatives, protectors of childhood, nationalists, etc. I imagine that many of the neo-nazi groups are here also. Its my experience of right-wingers that on the whole they don't want you to know what they are up too. I remember an arts center open mic night which I was attending being infiltrated by five or six or them. It was a surreal situation because none of them were actually musicians - they pretended to be comedians which allowed them the right to attend and perform. The woman who ran the night and who had no idea of how the BNP (British National Party) worked had put one of them in charge. I emailed the arts center due to the fact that I knew some of the people who ran the open mic nights (including the woman who had been put in overall charge and had made the decision to put him in charge) and got an email back saying the open mic nights were for everyone regardless of their political views. A week or two later I received another email saying that the arts center had decided to separate the comedy from the music by having separate nights for both. I'm  not too sure why but I do know that at one of the open mic nights the leader of this small BNP cell had been put in charge and after one of the singers had finished (she was colored) he said something that was really strange. I can't say what because people who were there may be reading this but it was racist. About a hundred people witnessed and heard what he said and everyone just sat silently in shock not knowing how to react - after all he was in charge. Now that is power. When you can persuade others that your intent is one thing and then position yourself to impose your will or views upon those who believe your original lie - well that is political power. Its not even a right wing thing since many left wing leaders have used to same ploy. It is the nature of a dogmatic personality who is seeking power to follow such a course when faced with opposition to their dogma. Here's what happened after the torrent scene released the membership list of the BNP and I spotted that one of them was a town planning consultant employed by my local council. I sent an email to my council of course. Evidently my council believe that hiring a BNP member as a town planning consultant for one of the most highly diverse ethnic towns in England was fine because his racist views shouldn't affect his ability to provide good advice. lol

I did not appreciate that you randomly altered part of the long string that is the url for Ref 8 in the article.

It took me time to get each book in its proper year, and to make sure the television adaptations were correctly described as to series, episode and year, and matching that overall page as well as IMDb information.  Not every novel was adapted for television. So I put those links back, for consistency across The Cadfael Chronicles articles in Wikipedia, the 20 novels and one short story collection.

Something Awful
This article was linked to in an article on SomethingAwful.com today, expect vandalism.  

Organization
The intro suggests that this article would do well divided into Etymology (already a separate section); the Technology of heavy cavalry, and the Social status (which survives). The exact status of knighthood, and its relationship to nobility, was somewhat different in Great Britain and on the Continent; we may want to divide again. 

Comments? 

Blind reversions 
Undiscussed reversions, such as this one, are deprecated. If Mr. Dunn would care to discuss the article, this is the place to do it.  
Extensive reworkings of the sections and text are also deprecated, which is what """"JCScaliger"""" has done, prompting the reversions he complains of.  It does not help that the reworking substantially weakens the text of the article and inserts inaccurate information.  It's hardly surprising that this user did not recieve any discussion when he added none himself while initially attempting to rework the article. 
I doubt that reverting to a statement that connects squire with eques adds much to the course of human knowledge either. A civil editor would stay off the revert button.  
A civil user does not accuse others of something he first did himself. 

Enough. Both of you are clearly knowledgeable on the subject, and agree that this article needs help. Bickering about each other's behavior is not helpful. Might I suggest collaboratively drawing up an outline (down to about paragraph level) on the talk page before moving things around further? This will probably be an easier way to work out disagreements than doing the moving on the article page itself.  

 Onward 

I have made a collection of minor revisions; I would appreciate these being left alone, whatever else is done. I will also collect and consolidate the several paragraphs which talk about the social effects of the expense of knighthood. 

 Ministeriales  

The assertion that ministeriales were always unfree, or are equivalent to servile knights, appears to be a confusion:

Language failed to make any clear distinction between these forms of service, so long as they were not included in the honourable category of knightly obligations. Artisans, domestic servants, messengers, estate managers, bailiffs in the lord's immediate circle - these were all comprised under a single head. The Latin of the charters (an international language) usually called them ministeriales; in French, they were known as sergents; in German Dienstmänner. (Bloch, p. 337, emphasis added). 

There were servile and unservile ministeriales; and until the thirteenth century, there were serf knights. p.338, 341. I am therefore restoring the paragraphs summarizing this, and marking them disputed also.   

Bloch incorrectly interprets the word ministerialis.  There were no unservile German ministeriales.  Read Benjamin Arnold, German Knighthood 1050-1300, pages 17-18:

"""" ... [I]t is clear that the type of German knight regularly called ministerialis in the Latin sources was being enfoeffed on a large schale in the eleventh century.

            What would you not do to restore to life the ones you have lost to death? I am not talking about voodoo or some black magic. I am talking about obituaries. These are small memoirs or biographical sketches of the deceased ones which are usually published in newspapers. These may also be in the form of a notice about an upcoming funeral or death anniversary, with details about the subject.

            Death is a loss that cannot be reimbursed, but it is inevitable and it is the truth of life. One cannot escape it. So mourning it will only increase the pain. Instead, by reliving the good old times and cherishing the best of the memories, we can make the distant souls rest in peace. 
            They might have left never to return, but their memories are there to linger. An obituary is the only way of paying reverence and expressing our affection for them, to preserve what is left of them, to make them immortal. 
The advent of technology has made it even easier to make our tribute through online obituary services. Life goes on and for those who have an overly busy schedule; these services have proven to be a boon.
             Ideated and founded by Mr. Rajith Rajappan and his colleague Ruhee Sabins, Oobituary.com is one such site that allows you to upload pictures, visuals, audios and videos to your page apart from the text. It is a platform where people from all over the world come together and share their feelings in the memory of their lost beloved. If you desire otherwise, you can also customize your page and make it accessible to only select friends and relatives and inform them by notify them by sending link to their email ids. After clicking on the link and signing up, they will be directed to your post, where they can comment. This page shall remain active till eternity unless you make a special request to delete your account.

It's upsetting for me to see that someone can falsify and deny the existence of true Turkish novelist F. Rifat Ulkuman just for not to get punished because of the vandalism. I really wonder if you did a complete research about him before deleting his article but just because some random person claims that he doesn't exist, shouldn't give you a right to delete the article of such a big novelist and politician. Labeling the life and publications of such a person as 'Hoax' is a serious claim which needs to be supported by a great research and some and as i can see you haven't done that ,did you? Even though doing that research should be your job let me help you to realize what a serious mistake you have done.

Gay and Lesbian tourists should avoid the Cayman Islands because of both the local culture and the fact that certain laws and customs are still in effect from British Colonial rule. Homosexuality is illegal in the Cayman Islands, and gay men and lesbians will be jailed and expelled from the Cayman Islands if caught.

The cite, however, makes clear that homosexuality is not illegal in the Caymans, though there is a tradition of homophobia and a documented incident of an American tourist briefly detained for a public show of affection. The cited source makes no mention of likelihood of imprisonment or expulsion. Nor is the exhortation to avoid the Caymans acceptable in an encyclopedia.

While I am somewhat dissapointed by D'Adamo's lack of footnotes, and frustrated by his avoidance of indexes, I haven't yet found a credible direct dispute to any significant claims of his. I am aware of a text that might indicate behavior of lectins on stomach tissuus would need to be directly studied, but I wasn't willing to spend in excess of $200 US (iirc) to find out what exactly it found, depite it being a """"real"""" scientificly strict (apparently, as I didn't actually get to read the) study. 
While not as rigourously strict with the science as it should be (at least what is presented in his books) ER4YT doesn't seem to be significantly paranormal or disprovable. So while it has a stigma of pseudoscience, that stigma hasn't really been justified.  Some supposed refutation I have come across turned out to be of even poorer quality, either reflecting it's own pseudoscience, or a lack of familiarity with the nominal subject. I would really like to see some explicit, maybe even rigorous debunking of D'Adamo's (occasionaly controversial? I can't see why) offerings. As of yet, I consider this closer to protoscience than unfalsifiable pseudoscience. 
In any case, I don't think that anything I previously posted on this matter is all that fantastic.  Is the mere mention of Doctor D'Adamo, or Eat Right For Your Type (ER4YT) enough to invalidate the respose I offered?  Other than that vague stigma, is my above answer to the utility of divergent blood types unhelpful or incorrect? I do believe that I was careful enough to avoid anything that wasn't NPOV.

An awful lot of books do still keep it merged in Rhus though (particularly the Asian species like R./T. verniciflua), so I think the Toxicodendron species should also be linked from the Rhus page as a lot of people might look for them there. -",0

 Sloppy use of the word """"criticise"""". 

In the sentence, """"References to testosterone poisoning are used as a convenient way to criticize men,"""" the word """"criticize"""" is used in an ambiguous and unhelpful way.  Granted, in the vernacular, """"criticise"""" is used as synonym for """"denigrate"""", """"defame"""", """"castigate"""" and """"belittle"""", but in an encyclopedic context, it would probably be a good idea to restrict it to its scholarly and intellectual sense of """"study closely"""" (which is clearly not the sense meant here).

I'd venture to say that its use in this sense is one piece of evidence that the Usage section at the very least could use some rewriting.""",0
"I have just spoken with Mr. Pettersen via phone and have sent all of the remarks from '''''' to him online. He, first and foremost, wants to greatly thank   for their kindness in the matter, and also said that DGG made up outrageous lies. He is greatly concerned that DGG is an editor, as some of his remarks were so grammatically incorrect on talk pages. He can also confirm that he has not been involved in any sort of blogging on bullying and he can also confirm that he has never been an author. Mr. Pettersen would also like to know if there is a more senior administrator that he can bring the matter up with, as DGG has been so extremely disrespectful.

 Jdorney really needs to grow up here. 

First off Jdorney, I keep it up, because you are ingnoring facts which I have continually provided proof for. I have submitted to you, the site, sources, page numbers, and even posted the actual articles in which these facts are stated.

Either you don't bother to read them, or you read them but ignore them because you are so biased in your beliefs that you only include facts that support them, and in some cases you lie altogether. How in god's name you are allowed to continue to be a Wikipedia editor is beyond me.

You basically quote two sources in the PIRA article...CAIN research, and Lost Lives. CAIN research is a """"estimated"""" source of information. Jane's Intelligence, the US State Dept, and the Council On Foreign Relations...all use official statistics for their information, they do not """"estimate"""" casualties as CAIN does.

As for Lost Lives...I have the latest edition of that book, and if you go through it page by page, you come up with the Loyalist casualty figures and British Security Service figures, i have put in the article. Either you are not really reading the book, or your are just lying about the figures, because you know they don't support your beliefs.

You also misquote other books. For instance """"The Irish War"""" staates that 46 Loyalist Paramilitaries were killed by the IRA between 1986-1997...you state in your article that this is the TOTAL number of Loyalists killed by the IRA, that isn't true. The IRA killed a further 38 Loyalists between 1974-1986, but of course you leave that part out. I don't know if you are some Loyalist sympathizer or what, but the way in which you continually ignore the facts about how many UDA and UVF members were killed by the IRA seems odd to me. I have given SEVERAL different sources for this number. Books like """"The Irish War"""" or the latest edition of """"The IRA A History"""" by Tim Pat Coogan. Jane's Intelligence, the US State dept. """"Patterns Of Global Terrorisim"""" and the Center For Strategic and international studies. Why these highly regarded sources aren't enough for you, I am not sure...unless you are trying to push an agenda.

All of the above sources agree on the number and breakdown of the British Security service people killed bu the IRA over the 30 year war. As a former US Marine, with experience in Counter-terrorisim issues, I pride myself on using the above sources, which were the same sources we used in our Force Recon, counter-terrorisim classes. And by the way, the IRA was one of the main groups we studied, along with groups like Hezbollah, Al Qaida and the Tamil tigers. These groups are known as the """"big four"""" to the US Military.

If the above sources were good enough for the Marine Corps...they are good enough for Wikipedia. You need to grow up, and stop deleting facts just because they don't support your own, sad, bias views.

I will file another complaint with Wikipedia about you, and I will continue to edit this article to ensure that it is professional and not the work of some biased little editor, who is more interested in pushing his own views then he is in the facts.""",0

I only asked you if you blame Poland for all German losses. I did not claim knowledge of you mine. There are of course Soviet faults but in total is some 80% of Germans.

>You are a petty nationalist (I would even say borderline racist) who tries to skew everything to make Poland look like the victim of history.

Call me as you want. I call my self as patriot. If Poland was victim of history? Well much more then Germany, more then Russia, more then Belgium etc. We were just between two major powers of Europe in the corridor, flat territory where all goes back and forth. This is the difference between Canada and Poland. Its geographical location. You should think about it.

>Poland is a nation that does not matter on the world stage. GET OVER IT,

No comments. Do you love anything, maybe you only love is dollar?

>don't keep trying to blame others/make excuses for Poland's failure. you can try to blame Germans/Germany for Poland's misfortune,

Do you mean forgot the blood which was bloodshed. You do not know what you talking about. It should be never forgotten just for the sake of future generations. In Germany still Nazi party exists.

>but her own leaders did not act to Poland's best interests in the situation, and that is why what happened happened.

What happened? The II WW? Anyway do you believe Canadian leaders doing good job? It is only shallow impression because some economic prosperity.

>If Poland's own rulers hadn't of weakened her before the partitions, the partitions wouldn't of been successful, end of story.

Yes, democratic countries are weak. Poland was in some sense democratic country (less then USA of that days).
Possibly if you know the constitution 1791 was the second on the world, just after USA. Beside role of “Solidarity” in last century it indicates something. Any way my impression is you know little about Europe history. There a lot of small countries which participation is important.

>asking someone """"are you a Nazi?"""" implies that you think they are. I don't know about in Poland, but when we meet a new person in the English world we don't automatically ask them """"are you a Nazi?""""

It was not automatically in the case of so many German arrogant. It was only an example in conversation with you. It was not a personal question. You to often exaggerate.

> and finally I don't care how or why Poland is suffering!

That is bad. You show many consideration how poorly German were treated expelled from Poland. Now you show no respect to the death in concentration camps. Just beautiful. I could not expect anything more. Now: Are you Nazi?

>I asked for a reference and got it, that is all that was needed. not some lecture from a crusading nationalist who likes to dabble in historical revision (but its more like historical denial)

For sure I need not lecture from you how I should treat my fatherland. Also I need not lecture how to treat German revisionism. I am not revisionist I accept the present borders of Poland ))), I do not look for revision. You do.

>The Potsdam agreement was not a binding agreement, and it never gave the land to Poland, it gave them temporary administration over the lands,

It is you interpretation check the American, British and other atlases. Give me the “temporary” proof if you can.

>and using that administration they expelled and murdered millions of Germans,

millions? Do not be funny. Murdered maybe accidentally a few, it could happened because the post war disorder. After the war, what was German fault anyway. Millions you are absolute arrogant, where came from the number. You will have to apologize I am sure. In total was 3 millions how many death. Such number you are perfect crazy in XIX century Trucks did kill 1.5 million Armenians and we know it and after WW II in center of Europe MILLIONS of Germans. I have no words on you insolence.

Here are violations you have done here. WP:3RR, WP:AGF, WP:CIVIL, WP:POINT, WP:THREAT, No Personal Attack. You must read the article again, especially the intro. """"Defrauding people of money is presumably the most common type of fraud, but there have also been many fraudulent """"discoveries"""" in art, archaeology, and science.""""  The latter two fields are distinctly separate even thought archeoology is a kind of social science, scholarly, it belongs to anthropology and history. Fujimura is an archaeologist, so that his case has been a good example of the archaeological fraud. Therefore, you should've provided a good rationale for your removal of the perfect example from the article. Rather, you insist on replacing it with Korean example in order to retaliate against my revert. You also placed the new addition at the top of the section, and the placement is very odd because if you really want to compromise with me, you should've made a group to Fujimura, the other archaeological case and the science case. You think Hwang Woo-seok case is more notable and I think Fujimura is more notable, so we disagree on the point. Besides, google search result is sometimes deceptive, and it is also funny that Japanese editors strongly disagreed to reflect the method at Dokdo and Sea of Japan. hmm.. double standard?

In addition, you blatantly lie that I erased your addition and don't want it to be included. Your threats and personal attacks truly degrade your reputation and credibility. I don't wonder where you get the idea to request for arbitration before WP:ANI or """"WP:RFC"""" that is two step forward, because I saw the same agenda at 2channel board.

If you honestly believe that this evidence """" has been debunked,"""" then it is incumbent upon you to inform the community of Wikipedia editors what led you to this conclusion.

"""

Wikipedia is not the place to publish original research.  Wikipedia will only give a """"balanced view"""" if such a view can be supported with citations from published literature, preferably peer-reviewed scientific literature.  Equally important, Wikipedia is a reference encyclopedia that has an obligation to note that this hypothesis is not currently accepted by any mainstream, reputable medical organization (CCHR doesn't count, as they are neither reputable nor are they a medical organization).  

Perhaps, instead of attempting to convince the Wikipedia audience as to the veracity of these claims, you would be better off attempting to publish research and convince scientists and researchers of the validity of these claims using evidence.  You mention that you are a psychologist.  I do not know about psychologists across the pond, but in the US, the American Psychological Association, the specialty society that represents and speaks for American psychologists, has been quite clear in stating their support for the mainstream view that ADHD represents a serious neurological behavioral problem.  The American Psychological Association has also not endorsed this Social Construct hypothesis, and many of their statements contradict this hypothesis.

In fact, the APA even has a page set up specifically for ADHD:
http://www.apa.org/topics/topicadhd.html

Now, as I mentioned, I am not as familiar with practice in the UK, but I did manage to find the NICE clinical practice guidelines for ADHD.  They can be found here:
http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/CG72FullGuideline.pdf

In any event, the problem has nothing to do with anyone being """"wedded"""" to any notion, but rather that the proponents of this hypothesis have published very little research and have so far failed to convince the vast majority of researchers in their field as to the merits of their proposal.  First must come the research, the evidence, independently verifiable information that can be cited to support the hypothesis.  That must come first, before you can expect to see any sort of """"balanced view.""""""",0

They usually only throw out a listing if they get offended personally, like little girls who get so upset because a boy throws mud on their face. LOL   Falcon, you can remove info, you can stick all the tags you want on Wiki listings, but those who know what real music happens to be do not care.  They know the difference between mediocre Coldplay and quality. They have learned the true reasons why material is thrown away or tags are applied, and they know that in most cases, those kinds of actions are meaningless.  I've seen listings here on Wikipedia that have had the same tags for years, and nothing more ever happened.  In fact, when I see a listing tagged, that tells me that the listing is probably of such high quality that certain jealous editors felt they had to deface it, so it deserves even more tribute.

Clearly, DZ, you're as well read on Biblical scholarship as I am. While I respect your learning, I must point out that the historicity of Esther is interesting, but tangential to this discussion. The article specifies texts """"referenced by, but not found in, the Bible."""" Whether anyone finds Esther ahistorical doesn't impact the fact that Esther is part of the Bible, and therefore, books described therein qualify for this article.

To pick over the list with esoteric debates about whether any or all of the bible is ahistorical is probably a worthwhile article, but the discussion doesn't go HERE. This article has a simple definition: If the reference is in the Tanakh, the reference belongs on the list. 

Secondly, I strongly disagree with using the preposition """"in."""" Using """"in"""" WOULD imply canonicity; using """"of"""" implies only that they're described by the Bible. 

Lest this discussion turn nasty, and since you and I are apparently the only people obsessed by the topic , perhaps we could reach a scholarly consensus of our own: If you want to go to the dedicated pages for the Esther-referenced texts and carefully note the historicity debate there, I won't get into a revert war.

ONIH has not addressed the issue, and he has also not answered my question.  

1. I said small would be more appropriate relative to """"minor"""" - """"""""Minor"""" reflects a point of view. """"Small"""" would be more appropriate.""""  Most appropriate would be to not have any modifier.  If the split was so minor, why are so many people still ticked off about it?  And it's not fair to say that the RSF folks left the movement, they just continued pursuing a direction they had pursued for years.  The """"movement"""" is bigger than PSF and PIRA.

2. I did not state that Peter Taylor is a """"mere journalist.""""  If I did, my apologies to Peter Taylor.  Indeed, please point it out where I used the phrase """"mere journalist."""" 

I did state that he has written some excellent books.  For better or worse, historians are not journalists.  They have different schools for each, in fact.  Provos accompanied a documentary broadcast; it's a great publication, but it's not a detailed history of the Provisional IRA.  The wikiepedia entry for Peter Taylor states, """"Peter Taylor born Scarborough, North Yorkshire is a British journalist and documentary-maker who had covered for many years the political and armed conflict in Northern Ireland, the so-called Troubles. From his experience he has written and produced books and television documentaries on the Northern Irish conflict.""""  The entry for J. Bowyer Bell states, """"The Troubles began in Northern Ireland in 1969, and Bell's The Secret Army: the IRA 1916-1970 was published the following year, and was one of the first detailed histories of the IRA along with The IRA by Tim Pat Coogan which was also published in 1970.""""  Many of the people that Taylor interviewed were also interviewed by Bell; and Bell probably interviewed them first and, in some cases, more than once (though Taylor probably interviewed several people multiple times, too).  

3. One Night In Hackney states above that he """" wasn't using one source over another, I was using what the source actually said.""""  But Bell clearly states, as noted above, """"Ruairi O Bradaigh, Daithi O Conaill, and about one hundred others walked out to form Republican Sinn Fein.""""  So, the sources disagree.  At one point, I believe, the word """"twenty"""" was in there.  It is not in there now, and from my view this is appropriate.  If the sources disagree we should not choose one over the other, but instead we should either acknowledge the differences and quote from each or find a way to be neutral  not quoting from either.

4. Once again there has been a dispute in which One Night in Hackney has chosen one source over another and then when confronted with a direct quotation from an alternate source he has chosen to ask questions, change the subject, and deny the validity of the source.  The reality is that Taylor and Bell are both valid sources, and Bell was clearly talking about people walking out of the Ard-Fheis.  Bell might have been wrong, Taylor might be wrong, but we as Wikipedia editors are not in a position to make that determination.  To do so is to engage in Original Research. WH.

"Hi Mihir. We all understand the complications you're going through. As I said here, an unacceptable burden has been placed on the CAs to make this poorly designed program work. We can be lenient when it comes to writing style, poor English, etc. These issues can be fixed gradually through copyediting, although I have to say that in some cases the English so poor (often resulting from copying text verbatim and then attempting to change individual words or verb tenses, or removing one or two phrases from the sequence) that the text is incomprehensible. Only editors who are subject specialists can copyedit such articles, thus greatly reducing the pool of editors who can make the repairs. Here's an example. The student had had multiple copyvio problems before and asked me to look at the new draft. I could confirm that blatant copyvio doesn't seem to be there anymore, but I simply cannot understand the content enough to fix the English or even comment on its accuracy.However we cannot be lenient on copyright violation, ever. The scale of the problem is now so large that it's now going to take literally months (and many editors) to find and remove it from articles edited by IEP students. The silver lining to this cloud is that we'll probably find and get rid of a lot of other copy vio that didn't come from IEP students. Hardwired control is one example I found today. The whole article is basically copied from Computer architecture and organization by John Patrick Hayes, and has been like this since at least 2008. Best,",0

Here is a section from the Whovian discussion page

Harlan Ellison is definately a fan...
Here I quote him, the highly critical science-fictioneer:

Whilst on the lecture platform of the World Science Fiction Convention in 1979...

""""Star Wars is adolescent nonsense; Close Encounters is obscurantist drivel; Star Trek can turn your brains to puree of bat guano; and the greatest science fiction series of all time is Doctor Who! And I'll take you all on, one-by-one or all in a bunch to back it up!"""" DrWho42

 A move would have been more appropriate.  Wikipedia isn't a genealogy site.  I would say the dreadfully obscure Van Rensselaers should just remain notes on their parents' pages.  And I think the disambiguation more properly belongs on the obscure fellow.

The other sources are relatively outdated so adding them in would not be representative of the November browser usage share. Also 2 out 3 of the sources were Europe only and 1 of those was excluded already for that reason. If more sources are to be considered they need to be global and reliably update at least monthly otherwise the medians would be heavily skewed in scope and/or time which would be a worse situation than not having them at all which is as it currently stands.,0

Excellent points about some of the other very important events in history! Reportedly, Columbus kidnapped a handful of natives and brought them back to Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand of Spain. Whether or not he was abusive toward them aboard ship remains undecided. Some say he was kind to them (according to his journal!) while others say differently. At any rate, with the order of Isabella and Ferdinand, the thousands upon thousands of Spanish Conquistadors who invaded America, and Columbus, himself, did basically cause the destruction of many of the New World Mongoloids (whose ancestors had crossed the land bridge from Asia to America many centuries before). How strange is Mankind? Two centuries before Columbus, the Mongoloids were responsible for the destruction of many Europeans (especially Eastern Europeans) during the Mongol Empire. Later, it would be the Europeans causing the destruction of many of the New Word Mongoloids in America. It's like Ghengis Khan = Christopher Columbus (with a special nod to Isabella and Ferdinand).

Eleland proceeded to get into a deletion war, would not entertain discussion prior to making wholesale deletions, and then contacted administration to have the sections struck out. Please check discussion for Admin's response. I do not question anything said by Manning, however it does not appear that he has looked at the sources as thoroughly as Fluri. Also Eleland placed warnings on the article regarding the veracity of the citations.

Admittedly, I have responded vigorously in discussion, but only to protect the material that had already been checked by Fluri. Anyway it appears that Eleland is on a messianic crusade to have it struck off the record. This is somewhat surprising given Eleland's herculean efforts to include material about Israel on the Caterpillar.Inc issue. Clearly Eleland is not the impartial arbiter that he would have us believe under """"Ed O'Loughlin"""" but a bit of an anti-Israel activist himself.

This is perhaps strange considering, and I quote Eleland in the discussion on Caterpillar Inc.: Editors must not remove information about an argument because they personally disagree with the argument. Wikipedia must include all notable points of view which appear in verifiable published sources. Reporting that activists have said something does not imply that the activists are correct. Removing those reports because you think the activists aren't correct contradicts Wikipedia's core policies. Eleland

"Request to Unblock
I began writing the following statement (excepting its two postscripts) before I was blocked. I suspect that User: AuburnPilot had me blocked, in order to prevent me from complaining to administrators about his misconduct. Although I was directed to request an unblock of User: Physicq210, who had blocked me, requesting such of the latter would require that I censor myself, and write as though User: Physicq210 had acted in good faith, and was one of the good guys. That would be surreal, and would give User: Physicq210 a moral legitimacy belied by his actions. And so, the following request for unblocking is directed at any administrator BUT User: Physicq210, but since I’m not a devious sort, I have nothing against the latter reading this. Indeed, I want User: Physicq210 to read it. For if I can be banned from Wikipedia for standing up to censors, then it is vastly preferable to go down fighting, than to go down the long dark road of self-abnegation and self-censorship, including the use of bad English. After all, if I wanted to be a lackey, I could go to graduate school.

WIKI Administrators’ Notice Board Incidents
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents

User: AuburnPilot

A few days ago, User: AuburnPilot began stalking me, checking wherever I had made edits, and going to the articles in question and vandalizing them. He or she has been manipulating Wikipedia rules as cover for what is clearly political censorship. User: AuburnPilot cannot even stand for Wikipedia readers to find out about factual material that upsets his political applecart through footnotes. Zero tolerance!

He claims of any source he politically dislikes, that it is either “spam” or a “blog” (or “POV,” another favorite dodge for those at Wikipedia seeking to censor those who fail to conform to their own POV), even though the one source is a previously published, classic magazine article otherwise unavailable on the Web (http://geocities.com/nstix/waronpolice.html), which the author has seen fit to publish on his Web site, and the other source is the longest, most thorough exposé yet published on the Duke rape hoax (http://vdare.com/stix/070113_duke.htm).

Note that I am not even talking about censoring writing within articles, since I hadn’t done any writing on the articles in question: Crystal Gail Mangum, Michael Nifong, 2006 Duke University lacrosse team scandal and Racial profiling.
I’ve been involved in edit wars before, though I have never been the aggressor, and have never initiated an elective edit war, though given the self-assurance that aggressors such as User: AuburnPilot exude, perhaps I ought to reconsider that position. It seems that aggressors rule here.

The reason I am making a formal complaint is that User: AuburnPilot has tonight upped the ante, threatening to have me banned
(http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:70.23.199.239&redirect;=no), if I do not surrender to his censorship. Should you find for me, please serve this individual with the wikiquivalent of a cease-and-desist order. Should you, however, find for the censor, please provide an Index of banned publications and a list of official wikicensors.

P.S. January 19, 2007 115A EST. Since beginning this complaint, I see that User: AuburnPilot has in fact succeeded at getting a crony, User: Physicq210, to block me, thus not only getting administrative support in censoring me, but preventing me from responding to his thuggery. (And no, I am not going to use cutesy, euphemistic language. If I were into such deception, I would have become a liar, er, lawyer, and would be worthless as an encyclopedist.) And I was unable to e-mail User: Physicq210 because I am not logged in and “You must be logged in and have a valid authenticated e-mail address in your preferences to send e-mail to other users.” (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Emailuser/Physicq210)

If this isn’t cyber-Stalinism, I don’t know what is! So, let me get this straight. Stalking and censoring an editor while using the equivalent of smiley faces (User: AuburnPilot’s penchant for saying “Thank you” after vandalizing one’s links) is “civil,” but complaining about such abuse counts as “spam, disruption, incivility, and personal attacks.” If that is verily so, then 2 + 2 = 5.

P.P.S The message here says that I was “temporarily blocked from editing Wikipedia as a result of your disruptive edits.” What the heck is that supposed to mean? For restoring footnotes and links that User: AuburnPilot had vandalized? If that constitutes “disruptive edits,” then you’ve utterly given up on honest English and all human decency. Sorry, but I don’t have any sympathy for the Devil.",1

Peacock words

WP:PEACOCK lays it out pretty clearly, and specifically mentions """"famous"""" as a word to avoid.  But people seem to wish to use this word, in one particular place only, in this article.  The logic behind avoiding the word is very clear: it's subjective, and described what people might think about something rather than any objective fact about it.  What is """"famous"""" to you is not """"famous"""" to me, and vice versa.  So either we liberally add the word throughout every article, to describe anything that could be considered by anyone to be """"famous"""", or we don't use it at all, unless it was used in a quote or other trivial exceptions.  It was decided a long, long time ago that the latter option would be better, and this was written down in the manual of style.

""""musicologist Joseph Kerman called it"""" is objective, concise, and verifiable.  """"musicologist Joseph Kerman famously called it"""" contains no additional information, only puffery.

First, I think it was SatuSuro who made the version about the Faith that is now on the page, and would like to thank him for his research and work. Both of the quotes I have added are verifiable, I can post the references again if necessary; they are not original research; they are also impartial in presenting the Faith's teachings because they do not attempt to sway a person one way or another about what to believe about them but rather present them directly because they ARE the teaching. Anyone elses summary of them could only be inaccurate. There are no major disputes as far as I am aware about the Baha'i teachings about the life of the soul after death. This summary of the Wikipedia article about a neutral point of view I believe is exactly what applies here:

When we discuss an opinion, we attribute the opinion to someone and discuss the fact that they have this opinion. For instance, rather than asserting that """"The Beatles were the greatest band ever"""", locate a source such as Rolling Stone magazine and say: """"Rolling Stone said that the Beatles were the greatest band ever"""", and include a reference to the issue in which that statement was made. Likewise, the statement """"Most people from Liverpool believe that the Beatles were the greatest band ever"""" can be made if it can be supported by references to a particular survey; a claim such as """"The Beatles had many songs that made the UK Singles Chart"""" can also be made, because it is verifiable as fact. The first statement asserts a personal opinion; the second asserts the fact that an opinion exists and attributes it to reliable sources.

Also, the Baha'i Faith has been consistently among the top three fastest growing religions in the world for about the last fifty years. There is sufficient public interest in it for it to be given due consideration on the basis of some other factor, and size and general public knowledge about the Faith are the only two factors remaining that I am aware of. As the Faith is growing faster than public knowledge can keep up with it it should not be considered solely from the point of view of the academic community, so the only impartial test for how much consideration it should be given compared to other religions would be its size, which is estimated at seven to ten million followers worldwide based on the most recent statistics and statements from the Baha'i World Center. Judaism has approximately fourteen million followers world-wide.""",0

 Let's end the last-name pronunciation debate once and for all 

Let's parallel this debate with a similar situation in English.  In the English language, there are some names pronounced differently in the United States than in the United Kingdom.  A good example is the name Maurice.  Maurice Gibb, of the Bee Gees, pronounced his name the British way """"MOR-ris"""".  Meanwhile, Maurice White of Earth, Wind & Fire pronounces his name the American way, """"More-EES"""".  I believe we should use the pronunciation that García Bernal himself personally uses, seeing as it is his name.  Therefore, the correct pronunciation would be """"gar-SI-a"""".  After all, a person can choose however they want to pronounce their own name.  If he starts pronouncing his name the Spanish way """"gar-THi-a"""" then I would agree that it is pronounced like that.  But until he changes the pronounciation himself, we must use HIS pronounciation.24.171.52.43  """,0

Reply
Hi, thanks for message. You can sign your comments automatically using four tildes ~~~~. Please add your messages to the bottom of the talk page, or they may be overlooked. I deleted your article because 
it did not provide independent verifiable sources to enable us to verify the facts and show that it meets the notability guidelines. It is now Wikipedia policy that biographical articles about living people must have independent verifiable references, or they will be deleted. Although you gave some references, two were to his website, one was reporting what he said, and the third only confirmed that he had left a record label. In any case, it's not clear what makes Hip Hop World an independent third party source as linked above.
I can't actually see from your text how he meets the notability criteria linked above anyway
it was written in a promotional tone. Articles must be neutral and encyclopaedic. Examples of unsourced or self-sourced claims presented as fact include:  He fell in love with hip hop... also inspired... he became interested in the art of lyricism, deciding to further his passion... decided to follow his passion... Known for being able to sing and rapping in pidgin or Yoruba... interest for music became a greater calling he could not ignore... was able to explore his range of musical talent... did not however leave him lacking in his ability to contribute... but it was all good natured fun... working diligently... to give his fans the music they so rightfully deserve...— it's long on mind -reading, opinions and spam, and short of real facts, such as record sales, awards etc.
You have an obvious conflict of interest when it comes to editing articles about this subject. Thank you for declaring your interest. If, after reading the information about notability linked above, you still believe that he is notable enough for a Wikipedia article (and that there is significant coverage in reliable, independent secondary sources), you could, if you wish, post a request at Wikipedia:Requested articles for the article to be created. See also Wikipedia:Best practices for editors with conflicts of interest.

"""==Nazirim==

A revision was made after someone added information about Nazerites, with a question in the comments of the edits.

Potentially, one could take the vow of becoming a Nazir upon themselves, but could not be released from the vow (so, it would potentially be in effect the rest of their lives, rather than a month).  Then, their child, I guess, could be a Nazerite child.  Because no 3yo (that I know of) would really be born a Nazerite . . . Nazirim, today, are out of the scope of this article.  Even Nazirim in the 16th century, I'd think would be out of the scope as well.  The article is not on """"Jews and Hair"""" but solely on the ceremony of upsherin.

"""Zeq you asked me to vote on Ramallite's nomination. The problem is that SlimVirgin nominated Ramallite. Considering my current dispute, I think it is inappropriate to vote. Sorry. If you just want my opinion, it seems from the few tussles you and Ramallite have had, you often edit POV bits into the articles, but at the same time Ramallite is incapable of respecting the NPOV facts that you do add or are contained within your edits to the point where his actions are just as bad. An example would be your addition about the number of wells cut off by the barrier (I can't find it now and only recall it somewhat). While some of your addition I remember as strongly POV, there were important facts contained within it such as that the Israel government says that no wells have been cut off. If I remember correctly, Ramallite simply reverted which is not appropriate. Another example I see is part of your recent edit. Some of it I think is POV such as implying all Israelis agree in the first statement, whether you meant """"Israel the government"""" or """"Israel the citizens"""" is unclear. One thing that irked me was Ramallite's reversion of the following addition: """"The Israeli government states that the purpose of the barrier is to prevent the infiltration of terrorists, and that any hardship imposed on Palestinians is an unfortunate side effect made necessary by terrorism."""" This I believe is completely true and you are attributing it so it should be easy to verify. The current version: """"Although the Israeli government has said that the purpose of the barrier is to prevent attacks and that any hardship to Palestinians is an unfortunate side effect made necessary by terrorism, the barrier's opponents say the barrier is the de facto future border of the State of Israel."""" is argumentative and implies the first statement is false and last statement is true as a result of the conditional """"Although"""" which implies contradiction. This is far more POV than your addition. Considering that he says he will continue to work on the articles where you have the dispute I would be inclined to oppose the nomination based on this alone. Additionally he seems condescending towards you, and I'm sure it is difficult to ignore that considering his edits and stay civil (though staying civil would probably help the dispute). I sympathize but will not vote.

""". Some just make things up as if it substitutes for the truth, and use """"mistakes"""" as """"proof"""" of being """"disruptive."""" But, very few actually can cite facts, inaccurate edits, nor bother to even think about checking sources cited. It is much easier to """"complain about Theodore7"""" and to """"revert"""" since following Wikipedia's principles about biting newcomers is an """"excuse"""" since it """"does not exist"""" and """"does not happen"""" to any newcomer. And, if they mention it - they are """"using"""" it since it doesn't exist, etc., etc. This is just one of the many problems Wikipedia newcomers face with such people. It is so much easier not to care about any subject, nor to check sources (as I do as a journalist) and to find inaccurate and unfactual materials while avoiding POV. But, to play games, to have personality conflicts as if they actually know the people they are writing to. They avoid resolving matters peacefully, but highly enjoy creating fights, building molehills into mountains, and love throwing out wild accusations. They don't ask - they assume - they immediately accuse, then complain loudly. They take everthing personally - all the while - not reading, checking sources, nor citing sources themselves on the subjects in question but adding plenty of their own POV that is not neutral, nor cited with sources. If sources run counter to their POV - then they use ruses to attempt to divert attention: and ask for RFCs on Wikipedia members who just got here, and request arbitration to resolve situations they have not even started to resolve on their own - yet claiming that they have tried. Perhaps, if some spend much more time actually checking sources, citing them, and making sure that the encylopedic materials are factual then, the """"revert wars"""" by some who want to re-write history to fit their own personal views would end, and Wikipedia could be that much more successful. So, if one is to gather evidence - show just where my edits are vandalism - where? I'd like to see it. Show my edit summaries. Show my edits, and don't cite my early mistakes as """"proof"""" of being """"disruptive"""" since I'd like to see someone claim they do not make mistakes themselves. Oh, one more thing. When a person defends themselves - try not to dismiss it as a """"diatribe"""" - but actually read it in context and take responsbility for one's own """"claims"""" against the person - in this case, a new member of Wikipedia. I've had enough of my comments being taken out of context, then pasted onto RFC and arbitration sections - and used as """"proof"""" of me being a bad person, and disruptive. I say different, and have the right to defend myself against what I consider to be a classic case of biting Wikipedia newcomers. I will take credit for my honest mistakes, but not for accusations that are false. My evidence are the comments, and retorts, and my edits - which, are cited, and soucred. Any arbitrator who wants to know more about my edits and comments can feel free to ask, or to view my comments IN CONTEXT and not TAKEN OOUT OF CONTEXT by some who are doing the constant """"complaining."""" I see no proof of any infactual edits on my part. And, my early mistakes are just that - mistakes that most newcomers to Wikipedia make. That does not justify, say your own comments Bunchofgrapes, and those of the other """"revert warriors"""" - who, in my opinion, are ruining Wikipedia. So, I've made inquiries elsewhere to make sure that perhaps this comes to an end, and that my case can be used as an example of what happens - negatively - to newcomers who run up against those who signed the RFC, and asked for arbitration.

The Ezekiel passage is quoted in the Moloch article in the 1899 Encyclopædidia Biblica as the strongest evidence for the theory that the offerings were considered to be to Yahweh (along with Jeremiah 7.31). Both passages are also cited in the Moloch aritlce in the 1908 Catholic Encyclopedia which reponds rather weakly (in my opinion): """"But this position is to say the least improbable. The texts appealed to may well be understood otherwise, and the prophets expressly treat the cult of Moloch as foreign and as an apostasy from the worship of the true God."""" It is cited in  1911 Encyclopædia Britannica: Moloch] with the comment: """"Note, also, the attitude of Ezekiel in xx. 25 seq., 31, references which cannot be explained away."""" The article The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: Molech; Moloch] treats it rather strangely, remarking:That this prophet regarded the practice as among the """"statutes that were not good, and ordinances wherein they should not live"""" (Ezekiel 20:25) given by God to His people, by way of deception and judicial punishment, as some hold, is highly improbable and inconsistent with the whole prophetic attitude toward it.
It is not clear what this means, quoting parts of the passage and paraphasing part of it and then adding """"as some hold"""". This article shows itself elsewhere quite aware of the theory that infants were sacrificed to Yahweh. It also brings in bogus Moloch-worship in connection to Carthage. Not a good article in any case.

Three different Rabbinical interpretations of the Ezekiel passage appear at . The interpretation by Rashi accords with the most obvious meaning, disliked by TRS, but the writer finds this inconvincing as not in accord with his own theology and prefers another interpretation. That would not be a reason to suppress Rashi's interpretation and the writer does not do so.

There is a discussion at  which covers in part John Day's treatment favorably but also discusses the Ezekiel passage in respect to the problem of the people's belief (and apparently Ezekiel's beliefs) that commands which Ezekiel saw as bad came from Yahweh. Note, John Day believes Moloch is not Yahweh, but that still does not answer the problems with that passage.

In short, the passage has been long used in support of the theory that the offerings of children lmlk was understood as commanded by Yahweh. It has long been in general a problem pasage. But those who feel that it is being misinterpreted do not suppress it. It is dishonest to present a theory that has been held and still is held and suppress its strongest supporting argument. On could respond by citing the Catholic Encyclopedia response (which seems to me weak). But add it with a citation if you will. But do not suppress.

The inclusion is not editorializing by me. I am presenting various theories that are held along with evidence for and against. The Ezekiel passage is cited as part of a common argument that children were sacrificed to Yahweh and normally used as support for that argument, indeed one of the main sources for that argument. My own POV, as much as I have one, is that the evidence is confused, there are good arguments as well as weaknesses in various positions, and that one should present all sides ... though of course full discussion would be a book length article. 

Your particular POV on a Biblical passages is not grounds to suppress it when cited with a different interpretation, especially when it is normally cited in the Moloch context by sources usually considered reputable, sometimes very much supporting the POV that the sacrifices were to Yahweh. Even when when that interpretation is rejected the Ezekiel passage is still cited in discussion.

I don't believe that anything I have included in this article, including the Ezekiel passage, is non-standard for discussion of Moloch. I have tried to present the vanilla arguments and give enough information to allow them to be understood. One obviously cannot agree with all sides. Moloch cannot easily be at once Yahweh, an entirely different god, the name of a kind of sacrifice. Passing through fire cannot be at the same time a human sacrifice or an initiation ceremony. But people do hold different views and the task of the article is to explain these views and give their history.

It should be obvious now that your original feeling that this material was novel was incorrect. Please let the normal statements used as arguments stand, regardless of the positions.

I am restoring the passage with some reasonable weasel words to make it clearer that this is the expound",0

 Pseudonymous editing 

copied from an email received offline
Hi,

I'm not quite sure how this works, but your wrote in my deletion review, """"you say that your name and address are available, but your contributions to Wikipedia are pseudonymous.""""

Does this mean I hadn't registered? I did so last night, and not under a pseudonym as most people have. I always use my real name in signatures.

And I don't know how to post to your talk page because there appears to be no """"post"""" link.

Thanks,
Dennis Bathory-Kitsz
bathory@bathory.org
bathory@maltedmedia.com

Thanks for your message but I think perhaps my meaning was still unclear.  Whether you register or not doesn't really matter since anyone can register under any name.  I could go online and register a Wikipedia account as George W. Bush (at least, if it's not already taken).  Wikipedia has no means to authenticate your identity independently.  All that we know - all that we can know - is what you choose to claim about yourself.  

That's what I meant by pseudonymously - any registration, even if you say that it's your real name, is technically a pseudonym.  It is not independently verified against some external identity database.  And for the most part, that works out very well on Wikipedia.  We want users and editors to establish themselves through their actions and to demonstrate their expertise through their edits, not by making claims to outside credentials.

By the way, anyone could also register as Dennis Bathory-Kitzs.  That trivial misspelling would be easily overlooked by readers but would still be accepted by the system.  Such a person could sign their name the same way you do, attempt to mimic your pattern of speech (well, writing really) and make subtle edits just to discredit you.  That, in fact, is a real problem for established editors of Wikipedia.  When we find usernames that are suspiciously similar to established users, we look very carefully for signs of vandalism or deceit.  Users who appear to have done something like that on purpose are generally banned from Wikipedia.  But those are all manual checks.  There is no system that can automatically detect or prevent it.

Likewise, no one can inherently trust the email address.  The way internet domains are set up, anyone could register bathory.org and create any email name they wanted.  Like Wikipedia accounts, emails and internet domains are unverified against any external identity authority.  And that's before you consider the problems of email spoofing and forgery - both of which are far easier and common today than any of us would like to admit.

Most people are honest.  But there are enough dishonest people out there that we have to build our systems and our procedures in such a way that it doesn't matter whether they are telling the truth about their identity or not.  That's why Wikipedia has a policy against original research (which we mean as """"a contribution or assertion based on personal experience"""") and why we never rely solely on self-published materials and why we bias our policy so strongly in favor of reliable sources such as websites owned by and operated by large, well-known organizations - organizations with both a vested interest in and the resources to find and stop spoofing.

Sorry to bore you with all this but my non-Wikipedia profession is information security.  The inherent problems of identity management and authentication occupy much of my waking hours.  How can a bank know that you're really you?  And how far can that trust be extended?  Under what conditions can an assertion be treated as reliable?  How do we balance that against the need to make systems and computers easy and accessible.  Unfortunately, there are no easy answers short of establishing a national identity database - something which would be in great tension with my role as a privacy advocate.  

Anyway, I'll get off my soapbox now.  Thanks for your message.

To post to my Talk page, just go to the page and edit it like you would edit any page on Wikipedia.  The most common technique is to use the little plus sign next to the """"edit this page"""" tab at the top.

You should also get in the habit of signing your posts on Talk pages.  You can do that easily by ending your comment with four tildes (~~~~).

"""
Fanboy is a term used to describe an individual (usually male; the feminine version fangirl may be used for females) who is utterly devoted to a single fannish subject, or to a single point of view within that subject, often to the point where it is considered an obsession. Fanboys remain loyal to their particular obsession, disregarding any factors (often including logic) that differ from their point of view. 

 Background 
Stereotypical fanboys are attributed with a sycophantic devotion to the creators and principles behind a work with which they are currently enthralled. Fanboys are noted for a very emotional attachment to their chosen subject, often taking negative remarks about it as a personal attack. They will readily engage in debates, but will fall back on emotional responses when challenged on facts. For example, a fanboy may go out of his way to point out negative and often untrue statements about their obsession's rivals. Fanboys are often hostile towards critical review of their chosen subject. The stereotypical image of the fanboy is as an unkempt, socially awkward young man who may be perceived as a loud mouthed pseudo-intellectual. Fanboys  are also typically aggressive and hateful towards the opposing brand or competition of their obsession regardless of its merits or achievements. 

As electronic entertainment gained popularity, the term became increasingly applied to video game and television addicts. As a result, a subculture emerged which readily labeled itself as """"fanboys."""" Within this group, more effort is taken to fit in with a perceived standard, resulting in a more outgoing attitude, even among those with insecurities. This outgoing stance is often felt to be abrasive by those not involved in the culture as deeply. The term originated in comic book circles, to describe someone who immersed himself in the fictional worlds of comics and the culture of comics fandom.  The term is often used in a derogatory manner by other less obsessed fans. The term is most commonly associated with adolescent and teen males but can be applicable to any age or sex.

The term fangirl, while similar, often carries slightly different connotations. The term fangirl is often applied to any enthusiastic female fan, regardless of obsessive qualities or not, and is often used with overtones of """"teenybopper"""".

History of fanboys and the term
The term """"fanboy"""" is most commonly associated with adolescent and teen males but can be applicable to any age or sex. It is often used in a derogatory manner by other, less obsessed fans. The term originated in comic book circles to describe someone immersed in the fictional worlds of comics and the culture of comics fandom. Common subjects of reverence by fanboys are specific: TV shows; movies; music; anime; comic books; cars; video game consoles, video games and MMORPGs; and computer operating systems, hardware and software.
 
Popular depictions of Fanboy stereotypes include the Comic Book Guy on The Simpsons and columnist Larry Groznic from the satirical newspaper The Onion.  In the songs of the fannish parody musician Luke Ski, many characters proudly consider themselves fanboys.

The earliest published uses of the word """"fanboy"""" have been dated to 1982.  One reference is to the cover of the """"Official Underground and Newave Comix Price Guide"""".  On this cover page are sketched overweight, overzealous comic book collectors wearing T-shirts that state """"Fanboys of America,"""" who are describing the extreme measures they would go to, including moving to San Francisco, to preserve their comics.

Also published in 1982, a comic strip appeared in Jim Engel and Chuck Fiala's """"Fandom Confidential"""" comic.  In the strip, Jim and Chuck met comic artist/writer John Byrne and collapsed into """"mindless paroxysms of adoration.""""  The John Byrne character responded that they were """"a couple of fanboys in bondage"""" (a play on words referring to a Monty Python sketch in which an Elizabethan era character reads what she claims to be a new Shakespeare work called """"Gay Boys in Bondage"""". http://www.byrnerobotics.com/FAQ/listing.asp?ID=7&T1;=Miscellaneous+Questions#154 Another early use is in a smart-alec editorial reply by """"Ambush Bug"""" to a letter in his comic in 1985.

It is somewhat difficult to respond to your statement due to the length of it and the huge poutpouri of points you make, but I will try.  

I want to stay focused and make, specifically, a case for the inclusion of a reference to the desolate state of urban Detroit in the introduction to this article.  First of all, though I hate to flash credentials, let me point out that I am not some urban partisan of one city or another: I am a graduate student in urban studies, and my goal both on Wikipedia and in my academic career is to understand and describe urban processes.  I agree with you in as much as most articles on cities on Wikipedia are exaggeratedly positive: alas, but boosters have their way on these topics.  Most major city articles could use to be more critical.  The Detroit one is simply one glaring example of the difference between real life and its presentation here.

You contradict yourself multiple times in your response (and, for the love of god, stop tinkering with it!  It distorts the appearance of our conversation).  How can you claim that New York City is """"five cities"""" (only two of the boroughs were incorporated as cities before joining into a single city in 1898; today, they are tightly bound by transit and employment patterns) and yet demand that the unfocused, sprawling Detroit metropolitan area be considered one city?  How can you stick to an arbitrary statistic about the wealth of Oakland county, and yet deny the significance of the fact that most statistics (even those that address metropolitan areas and not just urban municipalities) place Detroit near the top of the list of the most dangerous? 

The point that this article needs to make is obviously not that the Detroit metropolitan area is poor or that it is deteriorated; both of those statements are obviously false.  Rather, it needs to make it abundantly clear that the metropolitan area contains inside of it a vast segment of abandonment and crime that continues to be in decline for over five decades.  The existence of upper middle class suburbs of relative wealth and low crime do nothing to make the deterioration of the urban core less notable; neither does the recent redevelopment of a piece of that core.  

I must point out your focus on New York City is rather misguded  its deterioration and crime are now of a historical character; if Wikipedia had existed twenty years ago, one can only hope that it would have focused on NYC's urban wasteland character more.  In response to your other points, I would like to invite you to join me in patrolling the self-promotion of all city articles on Wikipedia.  You are certainly right, many of them do deserve to be less positive.  Let's start with this one.  

But, alas, I doubt that you will accept my invitation.  The history of your edits shows you spending much of your day chiseling away at the language of this page to make it more favorable towards its subject; are you paid to do this by the city's tourist bureau?  In any case, I can only hope that the casual reader would know to pay this page same kind of attention they direct to the boosterist propaganda spread by local town publications.""",0

Winnipeg has a annual mean of 3C, and it's nowhere near the subarctic classification, as it too has 5 months with a mean temp above 10C
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg#Climate

Your percent possible sunshine calculations are totally wrong. Helsinki has on the 16th of July roughly 18 hours of daylight, some 540 hours. You have put 280 hours in the July box. 280/540 = 52%. You claim 75%. As you can see, Winnipeg has 400 hours of more sunshine annually, and it has 50.6% possible sunshine.

YOUR SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS AND ADDICTION

You have literally wasted years of your life with this lonely, self-destructive addiction and illness, which has been at the expense of living your own life.  The depth of your mental illness must make it difficult for you to see the extraordinary insanity of your actions and how your addiction has stripped you of the life that was given you.  

I know a few others have evaluated what you do here and laugh at you and your sickness.  It's something of an inside joke, and I guess few share it with you because they consider you hopeless.  That's not right either, and I'd ask them to please stop that and try to help you.  Don't laugh at this person behind their back and then just communicate with them on routine matters.  That lacks all caring for a person who has an obvious and very serious illness. Something is very wrong with him/her, and while it may not be for us to diagnose the exact problem, we should pause to help with advice.  Please share with him/her what we all know.  It's only humane to do so. 

I will do so now too:

Jerzy (or whatever your name isconsciously concealed, I'm sure, to keep your illness as private as possible), please consider some uncomfortable facts:  Years of your life have now been totally consumed and absolutely wasted by your deep, deep sickness and obvious addiction.  Please don't make excuses for yourself.  You cannot go on like this any longer.  You need to stop, and you need to stop today.  Reject this advice, and I worry that your sickness will probably only deepen and your addiction will waste whatever is left of your life.  Please stop.  It's over.  Enough.  Move on.  I do wish you the best and hope you will take this friendly advice seriously.  It will be the first and last time I share it, and I hope you know that I share it only with your best interests in mind.  It's sad what has happened to you, but I wish you good luck and hope this advice is helpful.  But please take itand do so today.  You cannot go on like this.""",0

No, im not Ashley Favel - i know someone who could very well be his younger brother, but he and I are quite separate people. After a quick glance across his page, I can see why you considered us to be the same people )

The society has had many a notable event prescribed to its name. For example, a student whom is now a astronaut with NASA was once a humble member - Andy Thomas that is. Several other events throughout time, such as the hanging of a car on the torrents footbridge, the disassembly and reassembly of a entire vehicle into a corridor of the third level of engineering south, the stealing and ransom of Ronald McDonald from the myer center - all were orchestrated by AUES members. The way I have explained them here makes such events seem only of interest to a quite narrow, local, audience, but when thought about, they are things which can be told in such a way that they are of interest to the greater population. Things such as the hot water system in the Crown and Anchor pub, in the city, being removed by students during one of the engie pub crawls would also be notable, in my opinion.

ahh, have to run. will continue this later,

The vandalism was the insertion into the page of a controversial issue which has no bearing on the subject of the page.

No I am not missing the point; I am disagreeing with you. Since he still uses a regnal name, the """"other clergy"""" argument doesn't fly. He was a pope and is pope emeritus, so his article's title should remain as close to the established convention as possible. The fact that he stepped down is not a compelling reason to drastically deviate. Nothing in what you say makes any logical argument for why """"Benedict XVI"""" is the best form for a pope emeritus. In other words, in the formulation """"Because X, the unmodified regnal name is the most appropriate for a pope emeritus"""", you have yet to supply X. This seems to be more about your personal preference than rules or logic. Also, since the article should match the other popes after he dies, what we are really talking about is what to call him while he is alive. Does it really make sense to drop """"Pope"""" then add it back? What is the difference? Keeping the article where it is no more suggests he is the current pope than Pope John Paul II does or that Queen Victoria suggests she remains a current monarch. Even in the unlikely situation that someone arrived here from """"Random article"""" and momentarily thought he was still pope, that would be cured immediately by the lead, the resignation section, and the discussion of his pontificate in the past tense.

JanetteDoe, I appreciate your finding and uploading the Rao articles.  However, this can easily become an endless discussion.  For some other Yadav-apologist will soon come along and find an even more obscure source than Rao, and then you—conscientious and rigorous to a degree that the Yadav apologists are not and have no intention, aware or unaware, of being—will go scurrying again for the article.  After that we all will try to interpret it, weighing the pros and cons, again to a degree the apologists will not, for they will be busy looking for the next roadblock to toss in our path.  

I think we can't make the determination of whether Rao applies here or not, at least not yet.  Let the secondary sources do that.  We need to rely on recent scholarship, especially that in textbooks, published by academic presses and vetted both before and after publication by reviewers from a wide range of scholarly and journalistic backgrounds.  Two such books, by Susan Bayly and Christophe Jaffrelot, both widely used in universities around the world, both reviewed extensively in the literature, are being used in the article.  Let the article writing (or rewriting) proceed based on these (or similar) books.  Once the article has been fleshed out, we can come back to the issue of Rao.  Otherwise, nothing will get done, and those of us, who've taken time out from our other Wikipedia (not to speak RL) pursuits to attend to the article, will slowly walk away, out of touch and out of sympathy.  «Talk» """,0

We are ranked 5 on google, and get plenty of hits on our own, I was not trying to add my site here to receive more hits. PureGraffiti.com is going to be online for as long as the internet is alive, the gallery will be the biggest gallery of graffiti art online, weather one agrees with me or not, you can take a look at the stats and figure it out yourself. We are online for Graffiti Artists that dont have the knowledge or money to get their pictures up on a website that is already established and well known by almost everyone in the USA that is a Graffiti Artist. The store we have merely pays for the dedicated server bill costs to keep this huge site alive, and there are 500 other stores online that do advertize on google and other sites, we on the other hand dont. We also dont charge for the webspace, and we also dont have advertizing for money on our site in hopes to make money of our viewers like many of the sites you have accepted.

Please take all this into consideration:

http://www.Artcimes.org = first graffiti site. They have a store as well, and they have advertizing for money all through-out their site. Just because they are the first graffiti site, doesnt give them any special treatment. 
http://www.bombing.org = Advertizing for money all over the site
http://writers.org.ua = advertizing for money pop-up when visited the site.

  Hi.  Yes, that old conversation seemed to disappear.   Medeis removed it, citing a policy about """"threats of harm"""", as you indicated.  I reviewed it, after this deletion.  The OP said something like """"Geez, if I had to do life in prison, I'd rather die ... or I'd rather kill myself"""" (or some such).  Medeis took that as a suicide threat.  And did the """"threat of harm"""" removal.  The policy cited states something like """"take all threats seriously, don't assume that the threat is a joke"""".  I did not think it applied to that particular thread.  But, in picking and choosing my battles, this is not one of them.  Anyone  including me  might say """"I'd rather die than serve life in prison"""".  In fact, most people would say that!  And I don't think that constitutes a threat of suicide.  Particularly  by the way  given the fact that I (or the OP) did not in fact receive a life sentence.  A silly deletion.

Back to double jeopardy.  We seem to disagree.  And I do not have the wherewithal to engage in legal research at the moment.

Yes, it is my understanding that when a new trial is ordered, everyone starts from scratch, from square one.  (I am sure we both recognize that many things can happen in an appeal.  They are rarely cut-and-dry; they are rarely black-and-white.  But, in the cut-and-dry case of """"new trial is ordered"""", it is my belief that the prosecution starts with a clean slate and that nothing is """"off limits"""".  I say this as a general rule.  Perhaps the death sentence has some """"extra special"""": rules associated with it.  But, even that, I am suspect of.

In your case where the defendant is actually acquitted (on one charge), of course no retrial can occur (on that charge).  But, again, it depends on the appeal.  I am quite certain that the defense did not appeal the acquittal.  I am sure he appealed the """"rest of the trial"""" which did not favor his client.  So, in other words, the charge acquitted (assault and battery, in your example) is not even under consideration in the appeal.  An appeal usually has several points being appealed (not just one).  And the justices review each point, one by one.  So, in your hypothetical case, the defense would not be """"complaining about"""" (i.e., appealing) an acquittal that went in their favor.  They would be appealing the other things that transpired in the trial.  So, the final order of the justices might read """"a new trial is ordered with respect to the robbery charge"""" (or some such).  

Now, do you have a case to cite that supports your contention?

 Could there be another sub-section called """"International and comestic Reactions""""? 

I think it is pertinent to the article at this stage.

The Global Times (a Chinese daily apparently suffused with a glaring nationalistic view) article further said that while India's path for boosting its military strength has not met too many obstacles, the country is still poor (as if China is not) and lags behind in infrastructure construction (of course it does).

In Delhi, diplomatic sources in the Chinese embassy said, 

As a side note, India needs to take more consideration of external threats. And it seems naive to think that India can continue to develop as a global economic power without also bringing its defence capabilities up to the standards of other nations in the region. From our POV it seems poverty should be their priority, but the UK, US etc all have poverty and still spend billions on effective defence measures.

I would be glad to, Noformation. A conflict of interest is defined as """"Where advancing outside interests is more important to an editor than advancing the aims of Wikipedia"""". The aims of Wikipedia is to produce a """"neutral, reliably sourced encyclopedia"""". My position is that editors from the rational-skeptic wikiproject and their ilk are NOT neutral in this subject, and in fact are incapable of being neutral because they do not have any hands on empirical experience with acupuncture, no specialist dedicated learning in it, have not taken the time to grapple with the unique and complex paradigm that contextualizes it, and thus their knowledge of it is incomplete and immature, and they are ill-equiped to provide a full, rounded, mature and neutral synthesis of the information available on this topic.

Now, as for myself, I will tell it straight, I work 12~15 hours per week in acupuncture practice, earning $35 per hour. Acupuncture practice is not my main source of income, in fact my only purpose for practicing acupuncture is to deepen my understanding of the art and sharpen my skills in it. It requires 10,000 hours of purposeful practice to become a master of any discipline, and one day I aim to achieve mastery in this discipline.

I refute the suggestion that those people who are most qualified, have the most experience, have done the most study, and are most knowledgeable and passionate about this subject should be excluded from editing on the grounds of COI. In fact these are the ones whose input is most valuable, far more valuable than the input of ivory-tower rational skeptics who only bother to attempt to understand acupuncture through a theoretical, critical and dismissive point of view. In fact, considering the tone of most editors on the acupuncture talk page, which emulates the tone of those """"Quackwatch"""" websites that proliferate on the web these days, and considering their devoted following of Edzard Ernst and their elevation of his work as the number 1 source on the page (literally), and their transparent agenda of """"de-bunking"""" the """"pseudo-science"""" they consider acupuncture to be, it rather seems to an objective observer that is those editors who are """" advancing outside interests"""" rather than being neutral, and thus they in breach of COI, as opposed to I.

"Bot tagging 

Greetings,
I have seen your name everywhere already. Thanks for your recent attention to WP:PHILO and the aesthetics dept. I had recently been working on the logic project. I did quite a bit of work on it, and then ran up against some cultural issues.

I wanted to get User:SatyrBot (an apparently wonderful service!!) to automatically tag articles with the new logic banner for the purpose of assessment. I put together a category list, publicized the issue, and then moved forward with no objection. Well the complainers came out of the woodwork! The bot was stopped and at this point most have been untagged. I find all of this quite terrible.

Since then, I have been working on WP:PHILO with all of these task forces. I got the sense that people were a lot less uptight in general over there. I have changed direction a bit and now am advocating that the philosophy project tag incorporate these fields and be placed appropriately, etc. However, there is no real enthusiasm for the auomatic bot tagging proposal. Although there is far less hostility to it!  

I intend to ask the bot to tag just the Aesthetics project and see how things go. I haven't put this proposal out to WP:PHILO yet, I wanted to give you a chance to comment on it. Any advice or support in these goals would be appreciated.",0

"""P.220) (Q.) In your view, what does the word """"clan"""" mean? (A.) It has a general meaning of family, ordinary meaning of family, but there is a peculiar sense in which it is used for this quasi-feudal organisation in the Highlands, or you might say feudal organisation. (Q.) But its primary meaning, I think, is family? (A.) Yes. (Q.)In your view, did the clans in fact consist either of persons linked by blood or persons linked by reason of place of dwelling in a territory? (A.) That is the defination of the Act of Parliament. (Reference Acts 1587 & Act of 11 Sept, 1593 A.P.S., IV, p. 40) (Q.) Do you see a reference there to the pretence of blood or place of dwelling? (A.)Yes. (Q.)Are those familiar terms? (A.) Quite familiar. Pretence means claim....(Q.) So that in your view do you get this dual element entering into the composition of the clan, blood-relation and place of dwelling? (A.) Oh, yes, you have both.

I think that the reputation of the Marine Corps has more to do with its actual historical performance on the battlefield, rather than considerations such as the selectivity of its recruitment or basic training, something that probably would distinguish it in the """"European"""" perspective that you cite.
Another consideration is the scope, size and responsibility of the Corps.  The Marine Corps is not and has never been organized across its entire organization as a """"special-operations-type"""" organization, such as the SEALs, Special Forces, or, if you will, Royal Marines or SAS.  The article points out that the Corps is larger than the British Army in its entirety.  What the Marine Corps has done for most of its history, and what has distinguished it largely from the US Army, is serve as a mobile and convenient expeditionary force, in coordination with the Navy, in a large number of small actions in support of US policy, most of them in the Western Hemisphere or in Asia.  (THe US didn't even maintain a large standing peacetime Army until after 1945).  Outside those years when a major war was being fought (technically, the US Congress has declared war only five times in history), if someone saw an armed American in their country, that person was likely to be a Marine.
I would argue that the most relevant perspective on the reputation of the Marine Corps would be the perspectives and memories of its historical enemies.  I would invite anyone interested, and will work myself, to find and document in this article reliable quotes and sources of those who have encountered Marines in battle.

Whereas mediation is a waste of time, the foundation will jump if they start receiving legal letters requesting user contact details. They have to be law.

I approached both of them, him and Skinwaker very reasonably in the first place and straight off received the same modus operandi. he is what he shows himself to be. BTW, I have absolutely no connection with Canaen or anyone else but I recognise decency and indeceny when I see it.

Once one goes beyond the level of, say, The National Enquirer, the issue is not whether the source is reliable for any particular fact so much as whether the source is overweighting material that tends to attract more mass market interest.  Wikipedia was not created in order to just attract eyeballs.  The problem with, say, The Fox Nation, and The Huffington Post, in other words, is not that they lean right or left, respectively, but that they have a populist lean such that some discretion is in order.  For whatever reason, there is a lot more editor interest in adding (often without context), say, what O'Donnell said about mice with human brains on TV than there is interest in adding what a more """"boring"""" politician like Mitch Daniels said to The Economist.  And there is undoubtedly more reader interest in O'Donnell than in Daniels as well.  But our obligation here is to be encyclopedic.  The Encyclopedia Britannica is often found in academic libraries where it is read by stuffy people who are more interested in an informative read than an entertaining one.   Beyond this, one has to ask how many quotes of this sort even Fox News or HuffPo would have if they were to have a single story on O'Donnell, which is what we are constructing here.  All this to say that an edit that introduced this quote would be considerably more likely to have a consensus supporting its inclusion if it replaced some other controversial, widely criticized or ridiculed remark by the article subject as opposed to adding to them.

User Nescio has been deleting sections of the article he or she personally disagrees with e.g. historical police state examples """" Chile under the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet"""" and """"Argentina under the Proceso de Reorganización Nacional"""", as well as other examples . This childish and irrational behaviour has resulted in a blatant misrepresentation of the facts, which is detrimental to Wikipedia's credibility and accuracy. I have tried to reason with this user, but it is unfortunately to no avail.
Regretfully , I have no choice but to request that this user be blocked from editing at this time. 
Sincerely yours,
User Winston Smith

 describes you as “the worst editor I have EVER encountered on wikipedia” while encouraging you to “Please stop this childish behavior.”

 had his warnings to you about harassment deleted and reported you as a vandal * has repeatedly reverted to prior revisions of the police state article after being instructed to view the discussion page. I then placed a warning on  talk page, which he promptly removed. He continues to remove the warnings.  has requested sources for the addition, at least five have been provided, yet  refuses to acknowledge their existence and insists on trying to incite an edit war.     is continuing to remove edits and warnings of mine from his talk page  while falsely accusing me of stalking  and sock puppetry.   

It seems that you harass anyone who attempts to edit the Police state article without your viewpoint. This is against WP:NPOV policy. Please stop harassing users otherwise more effective measures will have to be undertaken.

As expected, you removed this comment for discussion in violation of wikipedia’s vandalism rules. Please do not remove this again.    """,0

In particular: In the second interval, both A and B should be flatted; in the third, there is no G# in the original tetrachord; in the fourth and fifth, there is no B natural in the original tetrachord; in the sixth, there is no A natural in the original tetrachord.

I'm also not aware of Webern or Schoenberg using this tetrachord much explicitly.  There might be a few of them here or there in their music, but I'm pretty sure it's not a significant feature of either's music (as it certainly is in Carter; I don't know about Perle).

 There is a way to indirectly reflect your source(your Dutch book) to """"Martha Gellhorn"""". First, you need go to the section concerning her attitude to Stalin or Stalin's communism in the article """":nl:Martha Gellhorn"""" and make the sentence sourced as mentioned above, showing the Dutch title(""""Travels with myself and another""""?), the chapter name 'Een blik op Moedertje Rusland', the pages(p. xy or pp. xy - xz) of your source, and so on. ISBN is preferable. Quote is possible and helpful for readers. Basically, English templates are available in any Wikipedia. 
 After editing nl:Martha Gellhorn, see the left side bar, (click """"Hulmpmiddelen"""",) and click """"Permanente Kooppeling"""". You can get the """"oldid=XXXXXXXX"""" of the page from the address bar. 
 Second, you need come to the section concerning her attitude to Stalin or Stalin's communism in the article """"Martha Gellhorn"""" and edit. 
 And before you click """"Save page"""", enter """"From [[:nl:Martha Gellhorn]] as of revision (date,month,year,time,)..."""" into """"Edit summary"""".
 After editing Martha Gellhorn, see the left side bar, (click """"toolbox"""", and click """"Permanent link"""". You can get the """"oldid=YYYYYYYYYY"""" of the page from the address bar. 
 Third, you need announce in the article talk page(Talk:Martha Gellhorn) that you translated from the Dutch Wikipedia. You have to make a new section and place this Template:translated page, that is, {{translated page| nl | Martha Gellhorn | version = XXXXXXXX | insertversion = YYYYYYYYYY | section = ?Political and religious views }}. 
 For more information, see Wikipedia:Copying within Wikipedia#Translating from other language Wikimedia Projects and Template:translated page.

Your reverts of the Ankit Fadia article state that you're """"removing material not supported by sources or cited to unreliable sources"""" So with that, there are 1741 mentions of Chennai Online, do you plan on deleting those passages in Wikipedia articles
mentioning Chennai Online as a source?

Granted there are one mention of Wendy McAuliffe and its in the Ankit Fadia article but there are 35,700 results for """"Wendy McAuliffe"""" ZDNet in Google, and at her current venture about page http://www.populatedigital.com/people/ mentions """"Wendy began her career as a journalist for ZDNet, the UK’s leading online technology newswire, during which time she became a leading authority in online privacy and child protection online."""" so that's another unreliable sources?!?

Surely an article about Ankit Fadia by Suelette Dreyfus is a reliable source, but you nixed that too.

You point to the notability page and revert the page, and I see in that document that Wikipedia is not a promotional medium, the way that article is after you revert the page, it turns into a promotional medium for Ankit Fadia, without the other articles supporting that Ankit Fadia is a phony, then have the issue of unclear notability to which having an article about Ankit Fadia. If notability requires verifiable evidence, how many mainstream and researched articles pointing out are needed to point out that Ankit Fadia is a verifiable phony? 

I can't take these donation drives for Wikipedia seriously if the basis for articles on Wikipedia are given to people with no grasp of their field, and hardcore plagiarism of other people's work without and accepting them as your own original work.
The research is there, maybe I'm not the editor for putting this together, but either Wikipedia should delete the article or stop sugar coating this article as a one sided promotional medium for Ankit Fadia.

 Spin-off, character pages 

When first writing, for example, The Brittas Empire character page, I thought it was written in 'an in-universe style'. However in retrospect this does not seem to be the case entirely, and I will be reviewing the page shortly.

Just a quick point on 'Edio*Magica', although it wasn't you who blocked me directly, it was still rather silly to think I would vandalize the very pages I have been improving (Sooty & co., The Brittas Empire), and to think that I would replace content with insults directed at myself. Due to the blocking I had to create this new account in order to edit pages, but I'm willing to forgive and forget about the misunderstanding.   
It wouldn't be the first time that someone has disrupted Wikipedia. In the past, we've had people create vandalism on one account, so that they can look good on another by fighting it. I realise, though, that your case is that there are probably some other bored little school kids using the same computer pool as you. talk to me 
Well i'm glad you've seen sense. What makes their actions even more pathetic is the fact they're university students; nevertheless they seem to have stopped now.   
Why don't you try and build an article to WP:GA standard, and get a better idea of conventions? Many of the articles you edit really could do with reliable sources. talk to me 

 Image removed from The Brittas Empire 

Are you sure the image you removed is not perfectly acceptable? It is a screen shot I took of the series so doesn't belong to any organization, and from what I’ve read relevant screen shots adding to an article are acceptable. I think you should have discussed your action before carrying it out.   
Having seen sitcom articles through FAC, I'm sure. Non-free images can only be used if they convey information that words couldn't express. My action was in accordance with the knowledge I possess through extensive ediing in accordance with Wikipedia's policy and guidelines, rather than ones I make up as I go along. talk to me

 Milton Friedman etc. 

I really don't know what I've done or said to produce the attitude you're taking. You can disagree with what I say, although I personally fail to see how any argument can in the end prevent Klein's inclusion in the Friedman article, and I can be mistaken, as I was in my first reading of the Norberg link, but I don't see how you can take things much beyond that. Nothing in my behaviour has necessitated the kind of personal, unprovoked insults with which you've decided to base this discourse. You do know, I'm sure, that personal attacks are entirely against wikipedia policy, and their especially bad form when done repetively and without just cause. You seem to take things fair to literally, or at least bizarrely you have decided to take that approach. I don't mean literally that people regard Friedman as a god, and having to explain that feels rather odd but I've decided to assume good faith as opposed to the more likely probability that you decided just to be awkward and provocative in your discourse. It is simply that a large number of economists and right-wingers regard Friedman as something similiar to god, infallible and above normal human standards. If its not Friedman, than its classical economics as a whole, which is apparently beyond any external critique. That, I believe, explains much of the absense of any proper criticism of Friedman on what in other respects is a fairly extensive article.

Regarding Klein, you simply don't have a point here, its as basic as that. It it not the place of Wikipedia to judge what is """"right"""" in any particular set of affairs, but to record those opinions which are notable. Klein is a best-selling and well-regarded writer with a reputation for fairly good research, her book was generally fairly widely praised and her criticism of Friedman is one of the most well-known in the contemporary world. It also covers far, far more than Chile. That cannot be dismissed because just because Friedman's supports or, for example, a paper by an institute that is itself the target of criticism from her book. As such, the rights and wrongs of Norberg's critique are fairly irrelevent. Although it could of course be included as a counter to Klein's criticism within the Friedman article, there is no case for using it to justify the actual exclusion of Klein's views. Now I know that a lot of Friedmanite/Friedmanesque etc. economists like to believe that there """"laws"""" of economics are a watertight and natural science and as such they are immune to any criticism that isn't likewise """"scientificic"""", and that presumably hold the same assumptions, but most people disagree.

Just to keep you happy, I'll discuss it briefly here. It has some very good points; for example Norberg convincingly shows there was a free-market trend towards the end of the century that goes beyond Klein's explanations (although the actual area of discussionof Klein's book were the far rarer, radical, fundamentalist reforms of the period, but more on that in a minute), he convincingly argues against Klein's account of events in Argentina and (mea culpa) China, his ridicule of Klein's """"Shock!Shock!Shock!"""" metaphor which I myself found unconvincing (as opposed to most her narrative and arguments) is fairly accurate and he makes a strong defence, in many cases, of Friedman. But his 20-page article is itselfcontains so many of of its semi-accuracies, disingenuous argument and near-falsehoods as to make any suggestion that it """"proves"""" Klein wrong, or even significantly weakens much of her basic arguments, completely ludicrous. I'll just list in no propersome of them since I don't have the time to do anything much else. 
He says she portrays the Chicago School as a place that brainwashed its students, as opposed to it actually being famously open to discussion, whereas actually she gives quite a significant account of its openness to disussion. 
This one's just basic commone sense; he says Klein's Friedman crisis quote isn't from any important paper but a preface to Capitalism and Freedom; the preface to the guysmost important book, he defining manifesto, isn't significant? Tell that to Friedrich Engels. 
He says that Friedman gave the same advice to the Soviet Union, China and Yugoslavia, """"yet nobody would claim he was a communist"""", well Klein mentioned this herself, not claiming he was a communist, but using it as an additional example of his somewhat undemocratic outlook.
His suggestion that the military was in control of the economy at the beginnning and the Chicago Boys didn't have control  until later on is simply false. While Pinochet accelerating his reforms as things went along, while the military held ministerial positions and while some statist tendencies naturally held on some level as they always will; Norberg is really here just selecting any facts he can that might appear disprove Klein's accoun",0

 Idea for Talmud articles 

Hi Eliyak: I am reposting the following request from User  on my user talk page for wider notification:

I was thinking of trying to stimulate development of a series of articles on Gemara concepts and doctrines, maybe to help children or newcomers to Gemara with explanations of some fundamental concepts that recur throughout the Gemara. Some examples might be articles on Yiush, Chazakah, Ta'aninun (as in """"Ta'aninun L'Yoresh""""), Eidim Zomemin (forgive my awful transliterations), Migu, etc., etc. Maybe we could even create a category or subcategory for it. I created Breira in this vein. As I don't have the experience or expertise in Wikipedia to know what to do to best develop this idea, I figured I'd come to you for your opinions on: (1) whether it's a good idea; and (2) How to best go about implementing it. Thanks

 Bhojpuri language 

Bhojpuri language is more similar to Awadhi, Braj and Hindi than Magahi or Maithili. And actually i'm unable to provide any citation due to lack of proper categorisation and consideration by authorities and so there's no published record. But if you want, i can prove my point.. Better let me do.
For example, if i've to say, """"What is you name?"""" in bhojpuri, it'd be, """"tahaar naam kaa ha?"""" in awadhi, it is, """"tahaar naam kaa hai?"""" in hindi, it is, """"tumhara naam kya hai?"""" in braj, it is, """"tahaar naam kaa hai"""", and in magadhi, it is """"tor naam ki helthi?"""" in maithili, it'd be, """"aahank naam ki chhe?"""".

 Why compare only to Windows 2000 features? 

As this issue has clearly caused quite a bit of confusion, I've decided to address it here. Windows XP is in the unique position - compared to all other Windows releases I can think of - of being at the convergence point of two separate Windows product lines, that of Windows NT and the old, MS-DOS-based Windows 9x. However, the core code in XP is based on the former and not the latter (hence XP has an internal version number of 5.1, while Windows 2000 has one of 5.0 - among numerous other things). A list of every single feature included in Windows ME (the last of the MS-DOS based versions) but not in XP would be quite long indeed, and also quite pointless, because it would be comparing operating systems of two very different architectures. (There's also the fact that comparisons between the other """"List of features removed in Windows"""" articles and this one would actually be made far more difficult.)   """,0

Your recent moves/edits to articles/categories/templates etc. can be commended per WP:BOLD - but unfortunately they are controversial and undiscussed. The correct venue is WP:RM, WP:CFD and WT:TFD - these moves need consensus behind them. If you continue to make such moves - especially ones to incorrect titles! - without that consensus then your actions could be deemed disruptive and may result in you being blocked from editing. Snowman 

Hi. GS, I think you are being completely mislead and do not have the facts in hand.  I have been following the proper avenues and have been meticulously improving the information that had remained incoherent prior to my immense contributions.  Absolutely I should be commended for it - not that I need, request, or desire commendation.
If you take your time, and really sit down to look through the entire history logs of both myself and what the Category:Fort Lauderdale Strikers page looked like, you would see that there was an entire mess.  Everything was disorganized.  I would gladly have a conversation with you in reference to the methodology used to place the information in order.  It is now in a suitable form that is representative of a Wikipedia index.
From the onset of my entrance to the Wikipedia team, I have been a contributor for the site who has only been bringing more insight by expanding articles or creating new ones.  You really should look into my entire contributions before pointing fingers.  This is not right and is counterproductive towards Wikipedians who are here to do good.
I have recently been putting in countless hours of tedious work towards improving the history of the Fort Lauderdale Strikeres and have placed very useful information.  The person above who is making the dispute and has come here making requests for your assistance has not made any significant contributions to the history of the team, other than fixing a title that was hyphenated on a couple of articles.  If anything, this person should be speaking with me as I am the one who has the proper knowledge of the subject in question and have been making consistent improvements to the relevant articles.  Furthermore, you should be speaking to this individual instead as he/she is the one who is editing without proper consultation to users who have been contributing significantly.
I ask that you seriously do some research on my history from day one to now, and put into proper context the positive value of my participation in Wikipedia.  Thank you.",0

Hi, another few points about the second subtitle: """"Would the preparations have been effective?"""".  I argue that this subtitle is too long.

Historians don't spend time discussing these issues. In 1415, during the battle of Agincourt, it WAS muddy, and so the French knights DID get bogged down in the mud, and so that is the course of the battle.

Thank you,  

 Civility 

Dear reader,

You are probably reading this because you think I'm an obnoxious clown.  Okay.

The thing about wikipedia that is magical is that we are a community of equals.  When someone (like User:Crossmr) unilaterally deletes a large swath of content against the stated objections of a number of contributors, it does dishonor to this equality.  When someone (like User:Crossmr or User:Scobell302) uses a threat of authoritarian action to prove that they are right, it does dishonor to this equality.  If you want to prove you are right, use the rights of all wikipedians (like User:Michaelas10 and User:Richard Harvey): EDIT!

Hell, when someone like User:74.129.234.170 tells you you're an asshole for being an asshole (or, in the words of a more tactful wikipedian, """"too bold""""), am I contributing to wikipedia?  No, probably not.  But am I honoring the spirit of equality?  Hell yeah!  We can swear at eachother until the cows come home without one of us depriving the other of the powers inherent in a wiki.  But if I wanted to contribute to an encyclopedia run by a community of rule-obsessed elites, I would submit to Encyclopedia Britannica.

Or, look at it from the utilitarian perspective.  I once tried to get in a revert war, and I found it was way too boring after only two rounds, so I quit (allowing User:Crossmr to get the last word...until a third party emerged from the community of equals to take my place).  But, man, throwing sand in the face of a pointless authoritarian?  Priceless!  I'll do it forever if you're willing to keep playing.  Bring it on!

Suffice it to say, I have a wikipedia alter ego, which has a couple serious contributions under his belt.  Or, to put it another way, I have a lot of IP addresses.

Convince, threaten, block.  Don't threaten, threaten, threaten.  It just doesn't work.

So if you want to revert my work, go for it.  I might argue with you, I might even be uncivil, but you can be certain that I won't block you or delete your contributions or even vandalize your encyclopedic content.  You won't find any proudly-displayed thank you notes from administrators on User_talk:74.129.234.170.

"Parishan, the claim indeed is true and you are actually not saying the truth, the evidence above gives examples of dozens of articles, not one. And your claim of double standards was being brought which you failed to address convincingly. The Azeri term is the Turkic term; Jerusalem’s foreign names are there for a reason. All Persian, Urdu and Hindi qualify as such because they are relevant and present in several historic documents, maps and manuscripts influencing other languages words for the place. There is no proper Azeri distinct term for the place, it is the official Islamic term and the variants are either Turkish or Persian. We can write Jerusalem in Zulu language too, it doesn’t mean it has any historic or notable value. The evidence above documents that the edit happened in a period when you have found various articles where Armenian terms were present and added Azeri terms when it was not relevant. It was explained to you that the Armenian term for Jerusalem was present because there is an Armenian Quarter in Old Jerusalem and there are manuscripts dating back to a millennium and a half. As for the notability, if you’d have taken the time to read others concerns, you will actually remember one example, in which it was asked to you to provide another source while you were stuck to one article in Azerbaijani admitting to have nothing else. You’ve been contributing here for a very significant period of time and should have by now known what qualifies as notable. According to your standards, any college teacher would qualify. We have enough problems here to have to go through your articles’ creation and bring the notability issue.

Also, Parishan, don’t you think that your consistent justifications questioning that it was retaliation are a little bit old? Are you trying to insult our intelligence? You’ve retaliated on various circumstances on various cases and this was brought to you on many occasions. Do you feel the need to have your memory refreshed? You deleted Andranikpasha and expended the other article, much like you have added the entry of Armenia in the anti-Semitism article in the past as retaliation, or worked on a NAZI person as retaliation to Vartan’s point which you misinterpreted. Or when you retaliated to one article where an Armenian term was added by adding Azeri term in a dozen articles.

"History is part of human civilization that has been neglected by the most 

Natasha- History is part of human civilization that has been neglected by the most. 
History is part of human civilization that has been neglected by the most. However, its significance is prodigious, and I believe it should be taught to all university students as a required subject because it expands knowledge, reflects the present issue, and impresses friends.

History tells us the stories from long time ago. Reading a history book is like traveling back in time to live in an alien era. It enables us to discover the origin of our lives to satisfy our curiosity and understand the cultural differences to help us live in harmony with peculiar customs. History untangles the mysteries in the past and assists us in the comprehension of both others and ourselves. 

History conveys important messages that assist us in dealing with present situations. By studying the past, we can efficiently overcome the obstacles at hand by emulating the previous success and by drawing lessons from the earlier failure. “D-day”, for instance, could not have been such a successful raid, if the allies had not formulated the winning strategy derived from the disastrous attack on Dieppe in 1940. In short, history reflects the present and teaches us how to face upcoming adversities.

Furthermore, knowing history is always a good way to show off around our friends. If we have accumulated rich knowledge of history, then when we go to a museum with our friends, we will guide them around and instruct them about the derivation of each item. They would definitely be surprised and exclaim in admiration. If learning history can bring astonishment in friends’ faces, then it is worthwhile. 

Time flies, and we, humble earthly creatures, only live in the present and yearn for the future. For the distant past, we are not privileged to see with our own eyes, but by learning history and utilizing all the historic records stored in libraries, we are able to find out what was happening, even in the distant past.",0

I removed the importance banner from the Dade Behring entry because I was editing the article.

I dont have the time to sit down and write the whole entry so I put up the incomplete banner.  When I read the importance banner and the page that goes with it(that says:""""This Wikipedia article or category is currently inactive and is kept primarily for historical interest."""") I thought that since I was going to edit the article, the banner could come down.  In the next few days I will closely read up on Notability and edit or remove the article.  Thanks for your input.

Evidently, you were incapable of considering the time spent writing the entries you capriciously deleted at a whim. Would it have been that arduous for you to have analyzed the differences and inserted the few lines you felt so passionately about? Was it too excruciating for you to trounce your self-endowed god complex on this completely free and volunteer site?

"Menopause and spotting 

Hi Invertzoo. ,
As stated “a woman who still has her uterus can be declared to be in post-menopause once she has gone 12 full months with no flow at all, not even any spotting.” I read everywhere that a woman must go 12 months without a period but I haven’t read about going 12 months even after spotting.

2.I was wondering if perhaps after spotting the time to being declared post menopausal was less than 12 months? Thank you",0

An allegation of misconduct is quite a different thing to an 'attack'. If you feel you have been misidentified as a troll then the guidelines on trolling tell you exactly what you should do, and also what you should not do. You constantly refer to various guidelines but I see no evidence that you've read and follow the guidelines yourself. As to 'good faith', I think the length of the discussion on the I...Butter talk page attests to that.

Personally, I think it is an important enough point to make in the first paragraph, although if Tim and others prefer moving it to the fourth paragraph I won't object.  However, I have to say I do not read the first paragraph the same way Graft does, I see no non-sequitor.  The subject of the first sentence is not inherited traits (that is in the predicate) and the subject of the second sentence is not fact versus theory (which again is in the predicate.  The subject of the first sentence is """"evolution"""" and the predicate provides a definition.  The subject of the second sentence is evolutionary biology - the field of academe that makes the study of evolution its object, and the source of just about all the contents of the article.  The third sentence goes on to tell us about what we learn from evolutionary biology.  This progression (define a subject, explain who studies/has expertise in it, then elaborate on this field of study) makes perfect sense to me. I don't mean to prolong any argument with Graft, but I just don't see this degrading the quality of the article or its educational value to a general readership.    |  Talk 16:30""",0

the next page is Electoral district of Townsville again he has """"The seat is one of four within the Townsville-Thuringowa urban centre"""" as with the others the urban area is what he says is the """"city"""" but the Electoral district also is rural so it is not just part of the urban area so I feel that on the Townsville one it should have Thuringowa removed and on the Townsville one have Thuringowa removed (please see my edits and you will know what I mean)...you will also see that he has said on the Townsville one that the """"Townsville Electorate is bordered by the Hinchinbrook (North), Burdekin (South), Mundingburra (South and West) and Thuringowa (West) Electorates."""" but yet he has put Townsville-Thuringowa on all the pages.
also please see the list of pages below as he has put Townsville/Thuringowa on them and it should read Townsville and Thuringowa due to the page being about places in both cities or the places in Thuringowa should be removed from this page or changed to Townsville and Thuringowa,

"No singers here, I guess. She may well have a 5-octave range, but singers are defined by their *effective* range, not merely the pitch boundaries of their natural range (including the falsetto). However, Carey is a phenomenal singer regardless of her full range. Hell, I have a range of over three octaves, but I'm only effective in slightly under two, i.e. I can really only sing in my effective range. I can *reach* the outer limits of the larger range but I can't sustain pitch accuracy or handle any considerable length of melody. Again, regardless of her range, she's proved many times over that she is effective in most of her range. Vision Of Love remains one of the most remarkable vocal performances I've ever heard. I'd love to hear her sing some of Hildegard von Bingen's music, she's probably the only popular singer who could actually do it with ease. Btw, Billie Holiday was one of the greatest singers yet her full range not broad - some say only about an octave and a half - and she packs more meaning and soul into her renditions than most better-endowed voices. Range is no determinate of anything but boundary conditions, the real news is what gets done within the given range, of course. Again, I think MC is simply phenomenal in that regard. Oh, one word more re: range and I'm gone: Captain Beefheart is also said to have had an enormous vocal range. I love his music too, but he was no MC. )

I think the ESPN sports announcer used that word in regards to Favre's effort in the game just as I was typing D,0
"That’s not really long and irrelevant. I mean, I told you above about General McCully who was always talking about really irrelevant things. Once he told me a story about myself (I’m not sure why I’d never been told it before by my family, but there you go, that’s families for you – not that I wish to make disparaging remarks about my family, they were quite nice, only you’d think that they’d tell me important things like this thing that General McCully told me).

Anyway, this story went as follows (of course, it being a long time since I lived in Fifestead, I won’t get it absolutely 100% word perfect, but I’ll get the plot details correct, which is all that matters in the long run, and in the short run too, probably):

Once, I went to tea with a girl called Sophie (to fully appreciate this amusing, and I may add, most relevant anecdote, you must realise that there was no romantic interest between myself and Sophie: in fact, we were both only four or five at the time; these ages are, you will no doubt agree, far too young for any real romantic interest to be taking place). Anyway, for reasons General McCully couldn’t quite remember (I was at least ten at the time, and being a fairly old man, General McCully didn’t have a fantastic memory), this girl Sophie (you may remember – she was the one towards whom I had no amorous intentions) put her spoon in my hair. Now, at this point in the story, you may well be saying to yourself, “So what?” But, the problem was, the spoon had a fairly large amount of yoghurt on it.

So this was, as you’ll no doubt appreciate, quite a difficult situation, and in the confusion I couldn’t help noticing the slightly random (and, I’ll have to admit, irrelevant) fact that the screws on which Sophie’s mother’s pictures were attatched to the wall required a flathead, rather than a Phillips, screwdriver (when I say flathead, do not use this term in its most obvious, literal definition, but as the DIY term in fairly common use).

Anyway, there was me sitting with yoghurt coursing down my face, examining the screws on my hostess’ mother’s pictures, and casting dark aspersions, and eventually I just walked out and went home, all on my own.

Now, when I make all these claims about being very friendly with a General, he may not actually be a General: the British Army (the army in which he had served) had several ranks containing the slightly bizarre, random and irrelevant term “General”, including Major-General, and I don’t know if he was simply one of these, since they’re usually addressed simply as “General”, as was the citizen of Fifestead General McCully.

Come to think of it, there even used to be a Brigadier-General rank and even a weird-sounding Captain-General rank in the British army, though I believe the rank of Brigadier-General still lives on in the United States Army, existing under some obscure, weird, bizarre, random and irrelevant star rating too, such as “three-star general”, though this almost certainly (speaking with an unfirm knowledge of that field of mathematics known as probability) isn’t the right term for the rank of Brigadier-General.

Anyway, being a busy person, I can’t waste any more of my valuble time on this, unfortunately.",0

 2008 BATTLE of KODORI 

Abkhaz separatists strike disputed Georgia gorge

Posted 11 hours 29 minutes ago

Abkhazia has said it has launched an operation to drive Georgia out of a disputed gorge, possibly opening a """"second front"""" in Tbilisi's battle to retain fractious breakaway regions.

The separatist foreign minister Sergei Shamba said Abkhazian artillery and warplanes struck Georgian forces in Kodori, a narrow gorge which cuts deep into the Abkhazian territory and is an ideal route for any invasion in the region.

The attack came less than 48 hours after Georgia sent troops to retake the breakaway province of South Ossetia, triggering an invasion of Russian forces dispatched to restore the status quo.

""""Abkhazian forces, in response to the Georgian aggression against South Ossetia, have started a military operation the Kodori gorge to clear it from illegal Georgian troops,"""" Mr Shamba told Reuters.

Mr Shamba said at midday (local time) Abkhaz warplanes launched airstrikes at the Tbilisi-controlled upper part of the Gorge and artillery was pounding the area.

""""Today was only the initial part of the operation by heavy artillery supported by aviation,"""" Mr Shamba said.

Georgians denied an all-out Abkhaz attack and said they were ready to face down any aggression.""",0

Theoretically, polygamy can assume any one of three possible forms: polygyny or the marriage of one man to two or more wives at a time, polyandry or the coexistent union of one woman with two or more men, and group marriage or a marital union embracing at once several men and several women.  Of these, only the first is common.

And on page 25 

A statistical analysis of Kaingang genealogies for a period of 100 years showed that 8 per cent of all recorded unions were group marriages, as compared with 14 per cent for polyandrous, 18 per cent for polygynous, and 60 per cent for monogamous unions.

Take off all your clothes
Get a friend, parent or whatever to take a photo of you editing wikipedia naked. This photo must be at least 1500x1000 pixels. (Editing the page Naked will extend your editing capability by 1 minutes but any other page is fine)
Upload said found to the wikimedia commons under a license of you choice
Go to the sandbox and put your photo there
Repeat the above step 12 times when the photo gets changed
Once you've done this, come back and click on view source. You will see a message on your screen for about 1 second. It will give you the name of a page you must edit. If you productively edit this page within 5 seconds you will now be able to edit the main page! If you miss either of this you will have to start all over again from step one (including a new photo)

"""

 About """"Two Chinas"""" 

I re-wrote and expanded the """"History"""" section for several reasons.
 One, I think """"Background"""" is more appropriate since the article is about the term """"Two Chinas"""". There is no actual thing as """"Two Chinas"""". So a section that deals with the background of the situation described by the term is better called """"Background"""" and not """"History"""" - """"History"""" should be used for a section on the history of the term.
 Two, there was a lot of misleading content in the article, such as the stuff about the Ruijin Soviet: I've seen that claim (that the Ruijin Soviet was the first time there were """"two Chinas"""") bandied about in online forums and anti-Communist China magazines from time to time, but it is factually untrue, since China was split between many autonomous entities throughout the Republican period, and the Ruijin Soviet was no different from any of them.
 In re-writing the Background section I was hoping to illustrate that history of division and separation in order to place the final division that led eventually to the current situation in a historical context.

I don't want to get back into the debate. My latest run-in with the Indian flag-wavers (thanks for noticing, btw) has made me very disillusioned, and I will trust your good judgment to trim, edit, or restore whatever parts of the text as you see fit. Cheers,  (Talk) """,0

"Forthcoming Changes, Outline 

The group of students at the University of British Columbia editing this wikipedia entry have tentatively decided on the following as an outline for the entry:

 History 

The purpose of this introductory section is to give the readers an insight and understanding of the background history of Hells Gate and its indigenous inhabitants. The First Nations people used Hells Gate as a prime salmon fishing ground, and because of this, it became one of many locations for a popular fish station. I also discuss the environmental reasoning (deglaciation) behind the presence of salmon, and subsequently indigenous people in the Fraser Canyon and Hells Gate area.   
 Hells Gate Slide 
This section will focus on the Hells Gate Slide itself, beginning with the construction of the Canadian Northern Railway which spurred the slide. It will discuss how human impact and the slide changed the water ecology and what measures were initially taken in order to solve the issue.   
 Environmental Impacts 

The main focus of this section would be damage to the local environment due to the slide. It would address the impact the Hells Gate slide had on the fish habitat, particularly focusing on the sockeye salmon runs disruption. It would then explore the decline in the salmon population due to the incident and would focus on the relocation of the salmon, which was unable to reach the spawning grounds, into other rivers.
  

 Social and Political Impacts 
In this section we will look at the social impacts on the native fisheries and on the commercial fisheries that happened as a result of the hells gate slide.

 The International Pacific Salmon Fisheries Commission (IPSFC 
Here I'll discuss how the Commission came to be, what it was comprised of, who was in it, how it functioned, etc. also their research (although this may go in the next section). This section may be relatively small, as there is already an existing entry on the Commission.

 International Dispute 
Discuss the disputed research methods and conclusions, and the escalating conflict
 Government Response 
This section will deal with the response to the slide - building of fishways, etc.

"Nowhere in the links you provided do I see that MPAA and BBFC classifications are non-notable. They are notable enough to have Wikipedia articles devoted to them. The information is displayed prominently at the beginning of almost all previews and in advertising for movies because of its notability. The information includes the UK and the US, the two largest English-speaking countries. How can you assert there is a Worldview bias?",0
"(ec with Marskell) Ottava, You seem to be very upset about this, and I am really clueless as to why (and why you hold this position about NPOV and consensus). Using your reasoning, we should never be able to oppose on comprehensiveness issues either, because if a consensus of the regular editors of the page says that the article is comprehensive, then it must be. FAC's entire purpose is to try to get a larger perspective on whether the article meets the appropriate policies or guidelines (in other words, consensus can change). I do think that the RCC page suffers sometimes because most of its editors have a very strong POV. That is understandable; people usually work on topics they are passionate about (either for or against). I fully acknowledge (and praise) that they are trying to make the article as NPOV as possible, but when you hold a strong POV sometimes it is hard to recognize where neutral actually is. That is why processes like FAC, GAN, and PR are essential, because then you can get (hopefully) the opinions of people who don't hold a strong POV on the topic. I would encourage you to post at WT:FAC to see what the consensus is for how to review an article - are NPOV and comprehensiveness concerns off-limits?  Or perhaps it would be useful to post at WT:NPOV to see whether there is consensus for your view that NPOV is decided solely by consensus.  Please let me know if you initiate a discussion, as I would like to participate.",0

"""
Dear Mr. Bunkov! Thank you kindly for your note. It is always a thrill to have someone working close to a certain subject to join the ranks of Wikipedia editors. Welcome again; I look forward to future cooperation, and I am sure other participants of WikiProject Russia will be equally delighted.
That said, I feel obligated to comment on the situation you are in. Pardon me if you are already familiar with what I am about to say, but I feel it's safer to include it for the sake of completeness. Since you are not an individual editor but rather a representative of a government organization, you should be extra mindful of Wikipedia policies and guidelines covering your position, of which he guideline on the conflict of interest is the most significant. Another important point is that Wikipedia is first and foremost an encyclopedia, so it's not supposed to include any material which is purely promotional. Even valid encyclopedic content may routinely be edited by any other editor, and understanding this point is vital for anyone who is planning to contribute anything. One cannot prohibit others from editing one's additions and no permission is needed to be able to edit content added by others. This, in fact, is one of the five pillars of Wikipedia.
This isn't to say that you must agree to each and every change others make to things you add, but all such disagreements should be resolved within the framework of applicable policies and guidelines. You'll notice, for example, that I've made a number of fixes to the style you used to format your addition to the Kaluga Oblast article—this is not because the style you used is somehow inferior, but simply because it does not conform to the style used across other articles in the series on Russian oblasts. At any rate, style matter are pretty low on the chain of importance, and as a new editor you are not expected to immediately be familiar with all nooks and crannies of Wikipedia's Manual of Style. You should not, however, be surprised when others fix it.
Style issues aside, Wikipedia is all about content, of course. It's understandable that as someone close to the source of information you will have a lot to share, but the applicable policies to bear in mind here are those on verifiability and reliable sources. What this means in practice is that every statement which can reasonably be expected to be contested must have a source, and the source must be a reliable one, published by an organization with a reputation for checking the facts and/or with editorial oversight. Ultimately, this means that articles should be based on reliable secondary sources, and in your situation it means that sources produced by the Government of Kaluga Oblast in general and by the Agency for Regional Development in particular would most likely fall under the definition of a primary (not secondary) source. Primary sources are still perfectly acceptable to verify hard facts, but they immediately become unsuitable once judgement is passed. In other words, it's OK to to use a primary source to back up a statement that Kaluga Oblast's GRP in 2010 was 214.5 billion rubles, but a secondary source is mandatory to back up a statement like """"this demonstrates the oblast's high economic potential"""".
With formalities and general introductions taken care of, let's address your question about """"Kaluga Oblast"""" somehow being a wrong translation. That actually is not the case. The term """"oblast"""" is a loanword in the English language, included in all major dictionaries, and it is much more precise than a more vague """"region"""", """"territory"""", or """"province"""". This isn't to say that any of those terms are """"wrong""""—they are not—but they are simply not as suitable for use in a reference work with such a huge scope as Wikipedia's due to their ambiguity. This issue had been discussed on several past occasions, and the general consensus is that using a more precise term is better than using a less precise one. Precision is actually one of the criteria used to select an article's title. Note also that all major English-language reference works use the term """"oblast"""" (see, for example, Encyclopedia Britannica). Additionally, since the article about Kaluga Oblast is a part of the series on the Russian oblasts, its title is expected to conform to the same format as the rest of the articles. WP:NCCS is the applicable guideline covering all this, if you are interested in reviewing it.
I hope this has been helpful. I apologize for dumping so much information on you all at once, but since your situation is different from that of a regular editor, I feel certain points should have been touched upon. If you have any further questions or need anything clarified, you are welcome t",0

In fact, in the first paragragh, there are SEVEN ways how to call Malaysia in various languages and scripts.

 The official language box can only have Malay because Malay is the only official language. Unlike India, South Africa, or Canada or Singapore of which their constitutions say there are more than one official language, Malaysian constitution explicitly says only Malay is the official language. Thus - only Malay in the official language box. Wikipedia's job is to spread information, not make new information. See WP:NOR.

 For usual convention, see Template_talk:Infobox_Country. For general rule of thumb on naming, see Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English). In fact, if we were to follow WP's guideline tightly, the first paragragh SHOULDN'T list the other SIX languages/scripts. An implicit compromise was made earlier on this if you cared to check the page history. If you push this, it's likely that, according to WP:UE, all other languages will be removed, undoing the implicit compromise.

 And for precedence from other article, see Portal:Montreal/Discussions/English Names/Draft policy. Also, Wikipedia_talk:Language_policy. See also United States of America - no Spanish despite Spanish is the second most spoken language in the US. How about Indonesia? As for your precedence, could you point to any where the constitution says there's only one official language while there are many other major spoken languages that are included in the box?",0

Anyway consider the matter off my worrylist D  talk

Also clicking a blue link to a users talkpage which is blank is also a big red flag. Or is it blue flag. Anyway, in this case I look through the page's edit history to find warnings.

Mathematical Chemistry, Theoretical Chemistry, Computational Chemistry, etc

I am not so sure that you have got the definition of mathematical chemistry and its relationship to theoretical and computational chemistry exactly right. It tends to be used in a very restricted sense covering such direct mathematical ideas as graph theory and so on. The contents of the Journal of Mathematical Chemistry are very restricted. I do not think mathematical modeling is normally considered as part of mathematical chemistry. Your edit to Computational chemistry - """"Computational chemistry uses the results of theoretical chemistry, in particular, its branch mathematical chemistry"""" is not, I think really correct.

Moreover, whether a few years earlier, Scott may have ranked higher or lower in a similar poll, is, despite implications of current article, certainly unknown.

If inclusion of his info is purely a matter of citing WP:RS, then based on this idea, one can more-or-less endlessly add cited material to this article, which as a previous Wikipedia Featured Article is doubtless a major Paragon in the world of publishing.

Lead, do you actually think the entire article is POV or do you think specific sections are? IMHO, the tags that were used were not legitimate. First, I have heard no editor state the entire article is POV. Second, if there is not  specific list of legitimate areas of correction, the tag is meaningless.

Images

Hi Bogdan. Regarding this your talk message: you can use the image request templates for filing standard images requests that will be automatically put to the respective category. I'd even ask you to do so. I requested that category to be populated: we need thousands of images on UA-related pages, so potential photographers (mappers etc.) need a consistent to-do list.

"""Is Ethylene Glycol a Synonym for Antifreeze?

Update 2 My intent in editing out the extraneous information of ethylene glycol poisoning in the Antifreeze article is that many editors and visitors to the Article are of the impression that all antifreeze is ethylene gylcol. This is a misconception. Case in point? Look above at the comments made by Flyer22 and TechnoSymbiosis. 1. Note that they mention articles in which the poisonous chemical is the Article in question. 2. Lead, Mercury (element), Asbestos, Benzodiazepine, paracetamol. That is a list of six 5 chemical substances and asbestos, which is virtually a chemical species for the purposes of this discussion. 3. Note also that the article in question here is not about a specific chemical, rather it is about a wide range of substances including the poisonous and deadly methanol and ethylene glycol. The article isn't about a chemical species like mercury or lead. It is about liquids (plural) which have special properties in commerce and mechanics and discusses practical applications of chemicals.

So when auto mechanics or airplane mechanics discuss antifreeze, or when chemists discuss it or talk about it, this poisoning aspect is a rare but useful part of the discussion. It is only when talking about this topic medically that the need arises to discuss the many symptoms and embark upon long-winded treatises on what happens internally to a person intoxicated on a particular antifreeze. In commercial, practical, and chemical discussions, the fact that something is toxic arises obtusely to the main concern.

Take those ethylene glycol warnings to the Ethylene glycol page and (if there was any sudden interest in it) to the Methanol article, which would be consistent with the 6 examples listed above. As a sideline, why aren't there any warnings of the deadliness of methanol, which is soooooo poisonous that it takes 10 mL of it to blind a person, and 30 mL to kill. Sounds pretty notable by the above standards, so let's list all of the symptoms in the antifreeze article, too. Or not. That would be borderline absurd, since the ethylene glycol lobby dictates that ethylene glycol is synonymous with Antifreeze.

Another absurd corollary would be to go to the Thermal insulation page and discuss how poisonous Asbestos is. I mean, all insulation is asbestos, right?

To summarize, this argument is about the scope of Antifreeze. I don't think this scope encompasses the symptoms of poisoning (from a particular type of antifreeze) which happen to be so difficult to spot that they deserve the full attention available at the Good Article named Ethylene glycol poisoning where all of the nuances of medical research and diagnosis can be discussed at length.   

 So fix the misconception, don't just blank an entire section.  

 Most antifreeze is still ethylene glycol. It's hardly an obscure risk.     

No one is or has stated that """"ethylene glycol is a synonym for antifreeze."""" And the misconception that """"all antifreeze is ethylene gylcol"""" can also be mentioned in the aforementioned section, although I have not read anyone in the discussions about this on this talk page express any misconception (especially since you've expressd such concerns before). Somehow, you are completely missing the point about why you are wrong to repeatedly remove this information. The point is that ethylene glycol poisoning, which is a part of this article, causes these symtoms; and therefore, there should be an appropriate summary of these symptoms, per WP:Summary style, before pointing readers to the article about it. It is not """"extraneous information."""" So once again, I will contact WP:MED to comment here on this issue. In the meantime, this information stays per the WP:Consensus against your repeated removal of it. 134.255.247.88

I actually gave thought to jesting in my response on the very AfD you were reprimanded for.  I don't like being involved in a debate with a person who doesn't help others to understand his position.  Your response could have been acceptable if you had said the version of the page that you voted on is crap because the x y and z claims are so baseless that they must be a joke.  The woman has a www.imdb.com page that is referenced on the page.  It is conceivable that because of its brevity you might have been confused about its veracity and validity.  However, she is noted in the msnbc.com page that you should have seen as referenced.  There is little reason to question whether a Veronica Finn exists meeting the description on the page version you saw.  The only way to improve the encyclopedia on contestable issues is if everyone attempts to enlighten others on why changes should be made.  Saying this page is crap does not help. 

 I apologize if the wrong conclusion has been reached regarding your editorship.  However, I believe it was correct and it is certainly supportable.  I support the original unblock denial.

"Khalatnikov 

JETP isn't scanned yet, so Khalatnikov's contribution, which seem to be closer to Candlin than Salam and Matthews (Feynman also does something similar to Salam and Matthews in one of the electrodynamics papers, but without the Fermionic coherent states, and without the justification in terms of sum over intermediate states, which are both found in Candlin for the first time, I think.) This paper talks about the result: the integral over Fermionic fields is defined following Schwinger so that the action principle will work, and the result is that the determinant is in the numerator and not the denominator. This is most of Grassman integration, but without the formal anticommuting variables, which seem to have been introduced by Berezin and Candlin independently (at least according to this source). I did not read the original Berezin articles, only the 1965 textbook, so perhaps they are more complete than I originally thought. If anyone has read these, please include a summary of the contents. The real question, in my mind, is as follows:

 Feynman's propagator approach only requires that the statistics be correct when permuting the ends of the paths. The rest can be done by summing over particle paths, with appropriate projections to deal with Dirac eqn. So the early authors, between 1948-1954 are all dealing with formal anticommuting variables (no complete theory). This is true of the Schwinger action principle, and to a lesser extent, of Matthews and Salam.
 Matthews and Salam, like Feynman in his QEDIII paper, treat the sum over histories as green's function manipulations, without trying to formally define a calculus of anticommuting fields. They do define anticommuting sources, and anticommuting field Green's functions, but this is similar to Feynman and Schwinger. It does not have the crucial addition that the algebra of the fields in space-time makes sense, and the Fermi field integral is a sum over intermediate states.
 Khalatnikov seems to have understood the modern thing: that the Fermionic integral is a concept that is well defined. Unfortunately, I cannot access his paper. If anyone has access, please find out what is in there.
 Candlin defines the whole thing, in a very modern way. This paper is the best on the subject I have read, but it is similar to Berezin 1964.
 Berezin has some papers in the 1950s and 1960s, which seem to develop the whole thing indepedently, starting with Khalatnikov's observation. These papers are also crucial- who develops the Fermionic coherent states? And who shows that the Fermionic integral reproduces the sum over intermediate Fermionic states?

The whole thing is somewhat implicit in Matthews and Salam, but also in Schwinger and Feynman. The real important development is the identification of sum-over-intermediate states with grassmann integral. If someone can point out who did what, it would help a lot.",0

Your make a good point.  Let me first address it from the perspective of Marshall Hodgson.

Civilization is a somewhat arbitrary term, often narrowly defined by language.  This obviously has its limits.  On the other hand, the more broadly you define a civilization, the more subgroupings it must include.  Eventually, we come to see civilizations as groupings useful for the purpose at hand.  And ultimately, civilizations, like religions, are self-defined.

Hodgson considers the lands of Islam to constitute a world civilization.  He calls Islam a world civilization in the title of his book The Venture of Islam: Conscience and History in a World Civilization.

For another perspective, I can turn to H. Patrick Glenn, in Legal Traditions of the World, speaking on tradition and identity.  Not all is arbitrary in the definition of a tradition, or civilization.

Glenn quotes Fernand Braudel, who speaks of an """"underlying structure"""" of civilization; """"those elements of a civilization which could not be changed without a fundamental change, or more probably disappearance, of the tradition itself.""""  Applying this criteria to Islamic civilization, one immediately understands that structure to be the religion of Islam.

To summarize: looking at the lands of Islam, with its concept of Umma, the shared traditions, the shared Arabic religious and often secular language, and indeed the shared religion of Islam, it seems logical to fall in with those who perceive the outline of a world Islamic civilization.

 Cite Example? 

If you have some sort of idea why editing the """"Roman Polanski"""" to include the title of rapist is disruptive or vandalism you should explain why instead of just unilaterally deciding that it is. You should cite more than just you think it is and explain specifically why you think that it is. There are many other Wikipedia articles that are very similar with respect to people who are known for many different things, one of which is some sort of criminal act or acts. These articles include titles like, rapist, criminal, pedophile, murderer, thief, organized crime boss and many others. Just look at the OJ Simpson article, it makes reference to accusations against him for murder in the first sentence. Where this title is seems to be at issue for some reason. Wikipdeia articles are usually vastly different in their writing style and sometimes titles are places in different places throughout the articles. Since there is no debate as to whether Roman Polanski is a rapist or not, and since it is the one thing major thing he is known for outside of his movie career should it not be included in the first sentence? Is there a specific guideline as to where in an article a specific title that someone has earned throughout their life should be placed? Should a person's most prominent title be their career, their ethnicity, place of origin, or some other adjective that describes a notable feature of their life? What specific guideline specifies this? Should it merely be what the person is best known for, because Roman Polanski is very well known for having raped a 13 year old girl and for being a movie director. Many people would say he is not known for his acting as he has few notable roles, or writing as he has written very little, but these titles appear in the first sentence of his article.""",0

"Journal of Rheumatology Article 

Ocaasi,
Have you had a chance to read the Journal of Rheumatology article I tried to add as a reference on the chiropractic page?  I don't know who quackguru is but I have a feeling from the name that there is at least a hint of bias.  The article by Ernst is the only article (with multiple flaws) that I know that has ever even stated that the risk by far outweighs the benefits.  Most of the articles I have seen state that manipulation (which is only one part of chiropractic) is at least as effective and most conclude that manipulation used with a multimodal approach such as with exercise therapy has a synergistic effect and is by far safer than OTC meds, NSAID's and prescription medications in the long term.  Think about it, less than 30 deaths after billions of treatments over 100 years is surely considered extremely safe.  I contacted the American Chriopractic Association.  They stated that they have already tried to provide information about scope of practice to Wikipedia but they are having troubles with posting to the page also.  If there is ever a source that should be considered respectable to Wikipedia, it should be the American Chiropractic Association (the chiropractic equivalent to the American Medical Association).  Please let me know what I need to do to get the more positive and consistent research to post to this page.  I am a little suprised at how difficult this is.  I have peer reviewed medical research and the American Chiropractic Association trying to provide proof that the information I presented was accurate.  I am not sure what else I can do.  Please forgive my ignorance.  I am new to this site and I am still learning the rules. 

Thanks,

You quickly forget that I am objecting to the MISINTERPRETATION of a 'rule', and the MISAPPLICATION of a 'rule'.   (or, do you not concede that, hypothetically, a VALID, proper rule can be MISINTERPRETED and/or MISAPPLIED?).  Merely citing the RULE is pointless, when the problem is the misinterpretation or misapplication of the rule!
 Further, Dodo violated WP rules, by not allowing a consensus of the group to develop.  He also misapplied a rule, claiming that something I said must be 'verifiable'.  But what does it mean, to be 'verified'?  Dodo implied that what I said must be verifiably, scientifically TRUE.  I claim, quite to the contrary, that since the article involved is 'Jim Bell' (subject, ME), that the only 'verifiability' issue is this:  Did 'James Dalton Bell' ACTUALLY make these claims.  (Or, conversely and hypothetically, 'is someone else forging his identity?, etc.)   For example, there was no need to RUSH and delete my posts.  Rather, somebody (preferably, one familiar with LOGIC) could have said, """"Bell, how do we know that 'you', 'jimdbell@q.com', is in fact the 'jim bell' (James Dalton Bell) who is the subject of the 'Jim Bell' WP article?  We need to be able to VERIFY the fact that 'jim bell' actually said/did this."""" (To ensure that 'jim bell' is not being libelled by a stealth forgery.)
In response, I would have immediately said, """"Good question!""""  And I could have promptly proceeded to do whatever was necessary to establish this fact.  Perhaps I could also have donated a recent (current!) photograph to the article, which (of course) could be compared with other published (even if not public domain) photographs which are available on the web.   
But as John Belushi was so fond of saying, 'BUT NOOOOOOOOOOO!'  Rather than HELP a 'newbie' (to WP), AND wait for a consensus, and actually help VERIFY that 'jimdbell@q.com' is actually, 'jim bell', Dodo decided to be an ass and repeatedly delete my edits.  And, he deleted ALL my edits, not merely some portion which (allegedly) was not 'verifiable'.  I will give an example, to the contrary:  I also posted a claim that I accused the Feds of forgery in a criminal appeal case, 99-30210.  In fact, in June 2003 I wrote a lawsuit (195 pages) which has (I believe) LONG been posted on the Web.  (Probably Cryptome/JYA).  It (as I recall) makes exactly this accusation.  So, if Dodo had actually acted INTELLIGENTLY, he would have edited my edit to cite my lawsuit, which has been posted for perhaps 5+ years.  (Or, he would have said to me, """"Bell, you need to show a cite of your lawsuit..."""").  THAT would have been productive, useful, and helpful.  (As opposed to being hostile, counterproductive, and malicious.)   So, why didn't Dodo do THAT?!?   The answer is quite simple:  Dodo is hostile, counterproductive, and malicious.  He's a 'control freak'.  (Apparently, WP attracts 'control freaks'.)  Rather than being assisting, supportive, and helpful, Dodo wants to slap around newbies who upset his apple cart.

Please, Buspar, stop trying to use IPs to hide your identity. If you continue like that, you'll be reported. I think you played enough.  

Ah, finally you use your true identity. 

Even though your usual IPs are from Pittsburg and this last one was from Duke University, I can't help but see it as highly suspicious that yet another IP comes and suddenly gets interested precisely in the 3 articles in which, just days before, you started edit warring under the guise of various anonymous IPs. 

Besides, I have already noted similarities in the behavior of this IP and yours (suddenly calling me a """"vandal"""" without any justification, arguing that this is """"important"""" while it is not...). So please, stop pretending.

If you're are accused (whether mistakenly or not) of a 3rd act of sockpuppetry, the only person to blame for this is you, and only you. You started to act under the guise of anonymous IPs, so don't complain if the other IPs that magically appear to support you (while they had never touched these articles before) are also suspected. Had you not used IP sockpuppetry twice, you wouldn't be suspected now.

You're also not in position of accusing me of anything, since the previous 2 IPs you used can unmistakenly be linked to your account. So don't draw unnecessary attention on your case. I'm not sure the admin board will be happy to see how you've already commited 2 acts of sockpuppetry that are certains. The 3rd, I admit, is debatable for technical reasons, but otherwise, given the context, it is highly unprobable that yet another anonymous IP that acts exactly like you wouldn't be you. Besides, the fact that you decided to magically intervene just after I spoke to the IP yesterday, is yet another element against you.

After all, I could also post with the IP of a UK university (while I'm in France) if I wanted. It's not rare to find this kind of IPs in proxy lists. So please stop trying to frighten me, and face the consequences of your acts. You've already used twice a form of sockpuppetry, don't try saying you're going to accuse me for stating it, it's only making me laugh.

So don't talk of """"NPA"""" and don't even try to argue that it would be an """"insult"""" to say that you would go to such length to """"pretend"""". Because you've already pretended twice before.

For the rest, I've got nothing to add besides what I've written yesterday. You made these edits under the guise of anonymous IPs only to take your revenge for our previous quarrels. I cannot see how they could be constructive in anyway. The nature itself of your edits is illegal, since you did them using a form of sockpuppetry, which is not tolerated on WP. That's why they were reverted in the first place.  And then, I cannot see what would be the use of these edits, because first they're all unsourced, and then, they have no use, no importance, no encyclopedical relevance, they were only made in a revenge attempt. And finally, please have the decency to stop talking about """"consensus"""", because first you have always ignored them (I remind you everyone was against your fansub edits, you did them nonetheless), so reading """"consensus"""" in one of your post will always make me laugh. And second, I don't think we can talk about """"consensus"""" when the the only people that support you are yourself and your own sockpuppets. 

So, just get over it. This is over. Don't try to take your revenge, it's useless, and you'll be the only one hurt in the process.  You have now commited enough policy violations, if we add sockpuppetry to your constant edit wars and disruptions of Wikipedia (and now, the fact that you try to alter and modify people's comment in your favor). In your own interest, you should stop that, because the only one who will be blocked will be you.  14:06, 27 June 2008 (UTC""",0

 Question about maltose binding protein article 

Hi Victor,

Just now I'm solving this problem with respect to this maltose binding protein tag, I found this article on wiki. And here is what you wrote:

""""...Once the fusion protein is obtained in purified form the protein of interest (X) is often cleaved from MBP with a specific protease. Protein X can then be separated from MBP by passing through the amylose column again.""""

It would be great if you can explain how can """"Protein X can then be separated from MBP by passing through the amylose column again"""" because I have tried it and it doesn't work. My personal guess is since MBP binds to maltose, it simply doesn't bind to amylose resins / column unless maltose is removed beforehand.

Then the question is how to remove maltose from MBP. From Davidson et al. Mechanism of maltose transport in Escherichia coli: Transmembrane signaling by periplasmic binding proteins (1992:

""""Preparation of Maltose-Free MBP

MBP was purified by affinity chromatography and was dialyzed extensively under conditions calculated to remove most of the bound maltose. For some experiments, MBP was denatured in 6M guanidine hydrochloride (Gdn-HCl) and either dialyzed against 6M Gdn-HCl or passed through a Sephadex G25 column equilibrated with 6M Gdn-HCl before renaturation by dialysis against 10mM KP1 (pH 7.0). UV-difference spectroscopy showed that the bulk of the MBP was free of maltose.""""

My humble Wikiquestion is - are editors even held accountable for libel or slander, as in real life, considering the reach and readership of Wikipedia.  What checks and balances are in place for rogue editor & admin, sophisticated in the policies, but manipulating said polices to achieve the same results.

In reading and researching, it would appear that many Editors and Admins, are behaving, contrary to the lofty goals of the Wikiproject, in order to forward personal or political agenda. Also what evidence is necessary to prove and rebuke and discipline such editors and Admin that are consistently and repeatedly violating 3RR and NPOV policy, if not in name, but certainly in sprit and in fact accuse other editors, who perform legitimate edits for the very thing that these rouges are engaged in?

Is what Wikipdia critics say is true, in that Wikipdia is the play ground of the faceless and nameless, who are not beholding or accountable to the rule of law or is Wikipdia truly has respected place, with proper review, oversight or accountability for actions, contrary to stated and publish policy?

Timothy McVeigh cited Libertarian Randianism as an influence, and there are certainly """"bits and pieces,"""" as you put it, of a uniquely Randian opposition to non-limited government in interview materials involving him. Why is he not in the """"influenced"""" box in the Ayn Rand article? Why was he left out/not included/deliberately kept out?????? There is perhaps not room for everyone, so why (is it important to)include LaVey, but not/instead of McVeigh? Why does LaVey but not McVeigh belong? Thus I am again editing LaVey out. Thankyou.

If you want detail about why it is historically nonsense: York and Lancaster were branches of the house of Plantagenet, competing with each other but not with some independent """"Plantagenet"""" faction. The house of Tudor was descended (maternally) from a branch of the Lancasters, who did not survive the wars. The first Tudor King, Henry VII, came to the throne by winning the Battle of Bosworth in 1485, which was Tudor vs. York. The next year he married Elizabeth of York which helped legitimise his claim to the throne; but any tensions in the next few years were Tudor vs. York, not Tudor and York vs. """"Plantagenet assemblies.""""
Research: I read the articles Plantagenet, Tudor dynasty, Battle of Bosworth, Henry VII of England, Elizabeth of York, checked the links  and a few on-line sources about Norton Canes, and off-line checked A.R.Myers, England in the Late Middle Ages, p.185, which lists risings and disturbances from 1486 to 1497 but does not mention this, and C.

"HighKing 
Your closure of that ANI report is unwise at best, abusive at worst. Ample evidence of wrong doing has been provided, maybe not with respect to the BI sanction (but even that is not clear cut, given it is meant to be broadly construed), but definitely in the sense that these edits are clearly the same terminology policing behaviour that led to that sanction, but on a slightly different BI related term. Action is clearly warranted. Archived or not, as I said, I am not going to let this lie, I will be informing Cailil when he returns. In addition to sanctioning Highking, I expect he will want to take issue with you disrespecting him by completely ignoring all the effort he went to in detailing exactly what is wrong with HighKing's behaviour, and what he should be avoiding. Who I am is completely and utterly irrelevant to whether or not HighKing is ignoring those warnings and engaging in the beahviour Cailil described as being not wanted here. He even made that exact point to HighKing - while Cailil has sympathy with the so called harassment he often claims to be suffering as a way of avoiding sanctions for making these edits, Cailil was crystal clear on the point that who reports him, or even just the mere presence of suspect accounts in any of these reports/disputes, has absolutely no bearing on whether or not he will act on any poor behaviour he observes from HighKing. I know he has previously expressed frustration at seemingly being the only admin here who is prepared to deal with HighKing, and I can see why with actions like this. Your closure of the section simply because of who the complainents are has only one effect - rewarding HighKing for bad edits. It's really no skin off my nose, is it? If I am a banned user, do you think archiving that discussion will have any effect on me? Or if I am not banned but this is just not my main account, then do you think archiving the section is going to change whatever reason I might have for not posting there with my main account? Of course not. The only thing it achieves is to remove from sight as an immediate issue. Which, given the fact Cailil was at pains to point out that HighKing's poor behaviour stretches back to 2008, is not a good thing for Wikipedia. You're an admin. You're expected to deal with long term problems, not sweep them under the carpet for wholly irrelevant reasons. If HighKing were ever to end up at arbitration for example, do you think he would escape sanction for persistent WP:TE behaviour, simply because other people involved were not following some completely unrelated rule like WP:SOCK? Of course not. Hopefully you can at least appreciate that as an admin, you being the person who maintains that cycle of WP:TE, is not only bad for Wikipedia, it's a form of laxity that really isn't excused by who I may or may not be. It also had the material effect of me not being able to correct Murray on a basic point of fact, meaning the archive now has errors in it, which I am sure is not the intent of that facility. Archive or no archive, at the very least, if, or more likely when, Cailil sanctions HighKing for those edits, I expect you to hold your hands up and admit your failure to do your duty as an admin in this case. Anything less will simply fall well below the expected standards of admins on Wikipedia. Anyway, I've probably spent far too long typing a post that you will most likely just ignore and delete, so goodbye for now.",0

The TIGHAR-Nikumaroro Fiasco
Two years of speculation and hype came to a numbing climax on
March 16, 1992, at the National Press Club in Washington,
D.C. At a crowded news conference receiving national TV
coverage, Richard Gillespie, executive director of The International
Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery [TIGHAR], unabashedly
announced that the Amelia Earhart mystery “is solved.”
Since early 1990, following the group’s first excursion to Nikumaroro,
a 3.5-mile long coral atoll in the Phoenix Islands, about 2,100 miles
southwest of Hawaii and three hundred miles south of Howland Island,
the national media had touted TIGHAR’s theory that Nikumaroro could
be the final resting place of Amelia Earhart and Fred Noonan.
The “evidence” Gillespie presented included a battered piece of aluminum,
a weathered size 9 shoe sole labeled “Cat’s Paw Rubber Co.,
USA,” a small brass eyelet, and another unlabeled heel the group found
on Nikumaroro during TIGHAR’s highly publicized return there in
October 1991. These items, elaborately displayed and labeled in a glass
case, all came from Earhart or her Electra, according to Gillespie.
“There may be conflicting opinions, but there is no conflicting evidence,”
Gillespie said. “I submit that the case is solved.” Gillespie then
bit his lip and looked down at the floor — a curious yet revealing display
of body language for someone claiming to have solved one of the
20th century’s greatest mysteries.
Gillespie and Patricia R. Thrasher, TIGHAR’s husband-and-wife
team, theorize that through a navigational error, Earhart and Noonan
overflew Howland Island and landed on a reef on Nikumaroro during
low tide. There they died of dehydration a short time later. The plane,
they said, was washed over the reef when the tide came in and now lies
under 2,000 feet of ocean.
The April 1992 Life magazine featured a six-page spread penned by
Gillespie, who cites Navy pilot John Lambrecht’s July 9, 1937 report:
“Signs of recent human habitation were clearly visible [on
Nikumaroro], but “repeated circling and zooming failed to elicit any
answering wave from possible inhabitants.” Gillespie called this report
“hugely significant” and “tragically inadequate. What had not been
done in 1937 had to be done now. We would have to search
Nikumaroro.”
Gillespie credited two retired military aviators, Tom Gannon and
Tom Willi, of Fort Walton Beach, Florida, for the theory’s origin.
“Using celestial tables, Gannon pointed out that on the morning of July
2, 1937, the rising sun would have provided the precise line of position
Earhart said she was running,” Gillespie wrote in Life. “By flying
southeast along that line, Noonan could be sure that, even if he missed
Howland, he would reach an island in the Phoenix group in about two
hours. Clearly it was the safest, sanest course to follow. I traced the line
on the chart and read the name of the island: Nikumaroro.”
This supposition was convincing to some, but Devine wasn’t
impressed. “There is considerable information in Gillespie’s rendition that
can be faulted,” Devine writes. “One example is his attempt to foster a line
between Howland Island and Nikumaroro. He presents Earhart’s last message
as ‘We are on line 157/337 ... We are running on line.’
Earhart never reached Howland Island. Earhart never
saw Howland Island, therefore Howland Island is not a reference
point for a landing on Nikumaroro. Earhart’s authentic
last message received by Coast Guard personnel on board
the Itasca, and recorded by Commander Thompson, related
no reference point: ‘We are on line of position 157-337 ...
We are running north and south.’ Earhart was not flying east
toward Howland Island or Hawaii. She was on a course, a
compass course or line of position 157-337, which terminates
on the island of Saipan.1
With Our Own Eyes
– 163 –
– 164 –
Earhart was not adept at navigation, and may have stated
her reading from a pocket compass she carried on her person.
She was probably and almost certainly stressed by ensuing
events, especially if Noonan had been rendered unconscious
during the almost disastrous takeoff of the overladen plane.
If Noonan had not been incapacitated, I assure you that he,
one of the best air-and-sea navigators of that period, would
have been communicating. He would have guided their
plane on a pre-arranged course, and calculated for accura",0

"English English vs American English vs ...

In an earlier edit changing petrol to gas, I wrote in the edit comment that I was changing the wording to American English (gas) because that's the standard for this Wikipedia. Another user pointed out that my assertion of an American English standard for this Wikipedia was incorrect according to the Wikipedia Manual of Style. That user is correct. I was unaware of the Manual of Style's position on this, so I read into it. According to the MoS, there is no standard form of English for the English language Wikipedia. Instead, the language that one uses in a given article depends on: 1) the form of English most closely associated with the topic, and 2) the form of English used by the first major contributor to the article. The article should, in any case, adhere to one standard form of English (for example, American English, British English, Canadian English, Indian English, or Australian English)

I'd like to talk about this for a bit, because I think we may have an interesting boundary case in this article that helps further define the MoS policy on how to select the correct English variant for an article.

English language variants and Unimogs
Item 1 above says that the version of English used in an article should be the one most closely aligned with the subject. The Unimog is a German truck, and so one would have a hard time saying that there is a particular form of English closely aligned with the topic, at least when it's spoken of in Germany. The Unimog has an especially weak association with England, as the British military and farm trades did not (as far as I know) make much use of the Unimog, instead heavily prefering the British designed and built Land Rovers. The Unimog was used in many other nations, however, including Switzerland (by the Swiss military) and some nations in Africa and Asia. I am not aware of the modern history of the Unimog outside of Europe, but I know that in the 60s and 70s, when it was at its peak in terms of exposts, it was purchased in these regions for military applications. In Asia and Africa, I am unaware of any particularly strong association between the Unimog and a given variant of English.

There was one market the Unimog was sold in where there was a strong association with a particular variant of English, and that was the United States. Daimler-Benz, through its dealers and representatives, has sold and services Unimogs in the United States for I believe over twenty years. 

To add to American English argument, in recent years, Daimler-Benz merged with Chrysler. Chrysler is a US company.

Further, the US company Applied Minds as widely publicized a variant of the Unimog called the Maximog. This Unimog has received press coverage (a Google search turns up articles on this project in the US newsmedia).

I believe that the Unimog sold more units and has a higher profile in the United States than in any other nation where English is the official language, though perhaps Canada could make a claim. I would like to hear whether others feel that the Unimog has a particularly strong association with Britain, Canada, India, Australia, or another country whose version of English is widely recognized?

English language provenance of the article
Item 2 above refers to the version of English used by the first major contribution to the article (excluding stubs).

I wrote the first version of this article in Sept 2002, and I think I could argue that this was a non-stub creation in American English. The article remained unexpanded until 2004, when other editors added content to it. These edits largely retained the American spelling, but (wisely) introduced metric measurements, which I believe are most strongly associated with Unimogs  I would be surprised if a German-engineered vehicle was built in terms of feet and pounds!

 Having a Rank, Edits on another page 

I was wondering if you could make me one of the Generals if I do good. It is a rank weaker than the Co-Founder, Co-Ordinator, 2nd In Command and many others that arrive before me. Please let me know.
Also, I have a problem with this Marcus2 in the Powerpuff Girls Talk Page. Not only me but also Rattis1 and probably some other users don't like him because he always delete quite important resources and ones that is known as comments like the Powerpuff Girls won the Friday Premieres or something like that. Please let me know.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs) 09:00, August 27, 2007 (UTC) 
The """"ranks"""" aren't really indicative of any power and only really serve to indicate who organises the project at the top level, otherwise it's fairly meaningless. You can join but you won't be appointed any title as it's a level playing field here. 

As for the ongoing issue with Talk:The Powerpuff Girls, I've been watching and noticing the edit war you have with  to me and the information about the ratings and demographics could be shortened as the article comes across as fairly one-sided and fanboyish with such info. You need arbitration but moreso need to get a consensus on notability and push the quality up so it can be opined correctly at Peer Review which many CN articles will be undergoing from B-Class down. 

Thanks for your enquiry though, hopefully this helped and if you require more help you can ask User Talk:Yngvarr who has a good record for helpfulness.   talk 

I'll take your words. Since you said that Marcus2 was right about the Cultural References thing, then I'll just let it go if he comes back. Thanks for your assitance Treelo. I'll try my best to make Wikipedia a peaceful place. I learned that I don't really need a rank after all. I should just, like I said, keep Wikipedia peaceful, that's all. Thanks again Treelo, I appreciate your opinion and comments. I'll try my best to completely follow the rules from now on. Alert me if you want to if you noticed me bearking one of the rules again then I'll change that habit As Soon As Possible. Thanks again.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

 Can you help me on this, please??? 

Since you're another one of the people who have worked for Iggy Arbuckle's article, I've asked you for help on this matter, along with the others. I'm trying to find out where I can go to ask the administrators for help on uploading images to the article mentioned, but I have had no such luck so far. If you can give me the proper directions, please drop them off at my talkpage. Thank you very much!  

I see. Well, I suppose the only remaining problem is that it's darn hard to find available images of the characters in the show. Got any suggestions?

Killer, I'm sorry that you have misread my unblock request. If you re-read it you will see that my use of """"pop-eyed chihuahua"""" there refers specifically, accurately and unequivocally to the dog displayed on your user page and not to you. I cited it to explain to why I used that imagery in the WP:PA, as otherwise it would appear inexplicably random. The explanation was not, as you seem to think, offered in mitigation. Indeed my original unblock request, which I condensed at the request of admin Hersfold, stated: 

The following will help the reviewing admin(s) to understand what otherwise would appear to be a random choice of metaphors.[...] Killer has a picture of a pop-eyed chihuahua dog on her user page,  captioned “I look like this”; and she is in the habit of referring to herself, in her sysopping summaries, as a dog   e.g. “Puppy has spoken.” Stupidly I exploited this canine imagery at Killer’s expense.'' 

I edited out that section along with others in an effort to comply with Hersfold's request.

My unblock request in no way implies that it is 'somehow OK to insult' you because you refer to yourself as 'puppy'. It simply explains where the idea for the canine imagery came from. It does not attempt to excuse my using it to insult you.

I have apologised, and still do, for my rude and offensive references to you personally in the WP:PA; and ask that you graciously accept my apology as sincere, which it is.   """,1

 The very concept of """"discrete mathematics"""" itself is a vague illusion  

The thing is, analysis is like anything else in mathematics. It can be built up from the basic principles of counting. That is, the simplest principles that build the addition function, which we think of as the number of elements in a union of finite disjoint sets of given sizes, and the multiplication function, the exponentiation function, etc, and anything required for general talk of """"the"""" number of objects corresponding to some act of counting, that is, to prove that it is well defined. These basic counting principles are responsible for all of mathematics, including analysis. There is only one mathematics. There is no distinction between discrete and continuous mathematics that is not exposed as an illusion if you look hard enough. There are no walls. 

It's fine to think about discrete mathematics in the same sort of loose way that people think about the distinction between number theory and combinatorics. For example, the Goldbach conjecture is easily stated combinatorially, and that's fine as long as you recognise the inherent looseness in what these two areas of mathematics represent. An article about """"discrete mathematics"""" can never be very good. All it can say, is that discrete mathematics is a hodgepodge of areas of mathematics which do not implictly involve the areas of real or complex analysis, or topology, for their study. Anything else would be far from the truth. I say """"implicitly"""", because real and complex analysis, and topology to some extent, can be very useful in these areas.""",0

 Help with CSS Reference Manual article 

Dear editor, this morning, I found a new article (CSS Reference Manual) initiated by another author (that I am not acquainted to). However, while the article was at that point (and this moment as well) clearly still 'work in progress', another editor/commenter  had put an 'AfD' on it. Because I feel a strong need for this new article to exist, I defended it strongly with valid arguments, even stating that I wanted to contribute to it myself. However, at the point where on-topic discussions based on argumentation seized to exist, the editor/commenter  started to attack me personally, by openly questioning my personal credibility.
At his talk-page, an earlier ban (half way of the page) is present based on personal attacks (although I am not fully sure that he was the one given the ban or that he was the one that gave the ban to someone else).

Nevertheless: because of this AfD, the article gets flamed now by other users that don't take a closer look at it, for no valid reason, just because it's currently labeled as 'AfD'...

My question is therefore: could you help me out to let this article be enhanced properly to Wikipedia standards?
Because I strongly feel that there is a need for it, it deserves a decent chance, because I would not liketo see very hard work thrown down the drain because of """"a bully"""" that was banned before for personal attacks, and because the article's initial author (again: not me) has done a good job in starting it.""",0

I believe the intention of the provision you have quoted, is to prevent wide-scale quoting of entire emails and entire email exchanges; that is the assumption I will work off when taking affirmative action (as opposed to reactive action, such as this), although I invite you to have the Committee comment on my interpretation of it. Regardless, I'll ask Offliner to paraphrase what you wrote on the mailing list, although having him do this could be to your disadvantage as it provides him the opportunity to represent what you said on the mailing list in whatever way and with whatever language he chooses.   
Daniel, I don’t mind you removing my entire section (at your discretion) for as long as you read it, by going back to my post, and relating to the particulars listed in it. However, there’s nothing in the initial provisions of this case indicating that you’re supposed to prevent only wide-scale quoting of entire emails and email exchanges. – That is your own interpretation of the warning which needs to be confirmed by the Committee. Meanwhile, quoting of illegally accessed emails includes also explaining in ones own words what’s in those emails, which in a way is even worse, because paraphrasing other people is obviously tainted by personal agendas. Cheers,  talk 
Quoting, out-of-context and possibly doctored emails is creating, IMHO, more problems than paraphrasing, as it gives an air of legitimacy to this harassment campaign. PS. Offliner is not the ony party quoting @s, Russavia is doing that as well. | talk  
(edit conflict) I'm charged, as the Clerk of the case, to interpret the directives I receive. Until such a time as I am explicitly overruled by the Committee, how I interpret those directives is how the case will be run. I have interpreted the directives and disallowing the quoting of the contents of emails, allowing the subjects of emails, and allowing the paraphrasing of content of emails where said paraphrasing. If you're concerned about mis-paraphrasing, the other alternative is to give permission to be quoted; otherwise, your emails can and will be paraphrased within reason. If you believe a paraphrase is misleading, you are free to address it in your own evidence section.
These are the rules for the case.   
And in response to Piotrus, either allow yourself to be quoted explicitly, or refute the paraphrasing in your evidence section, or else appeal my decision to the Committee by email to arbcom-l@lists.wikimedia.org.

This article will never be a FA nor a good article. It also had been the victim of some wikipedia rules that don't apply to other articles on this encyclopedia. When I first started to edit on wiki I was quite enthusiastic but later this feeling faded. For example the artcle had been moved to a name that is not used in the world of football. Steaua had always been known for its official name: FC Steaua Bucureşti. This name is used worldwide to refer to Steaua. I personally found this situation annoying and I suggest that a move should take place. I mean, the other Romanian football clubs with Bucureşti in their naming were not moved and those awkward wikipedia rules applied only to this article. 

Here are some examples about football clubs that have articles based on their official club names:

"""heading. My common usage understanding of the word is that it means statistical information about something, or the study thereof. My own 1990 dictionary says demographics: data resulting from the science of demography, and demography: the scientific study of human populations, especially with relation to their size, structure and distribution. So on that basis, the articles would be correctly titled 'demographics of...', and quote lots of statistics. It would appear to me that, according to my quite large dictionary, the article is wrong in its definition of these two terms. At the least, it should explain that there is a possible different understanding of the terms.
My own interest was how broad the term demographics is, and whether when discussing a population it would include information about the land area, climate, how wet it is, all that sort of stuff which undoubtedly affects and influences the people living there, even though it might not be the sort of information collected by modern advertising executives. I suspect that a difference in understanding of the terms has crept in because such people are only interested in a subset of the total information.   
 I completely agree with you dictionary. However the key phrase is """"the scientific study of human populations"""". Once human population is no longer an essential part of the study (as in climate, landmass etc. which will be the same regardless of population) it is no demography; I do agree that if climate has an effect on the population (e.g. in the arctic region people tend to protect themselves against cold) it is interesting from demography; but without such reference not.   

Non-families

I notice that a lot of Wikipedia articles use some sort of template putting households into four categories: """"had children under the age of 18 living with them"""", """"were married couples living together"""", """"had a female householder with no husband present"""", and  """"non-families"""". These categories do not add up to 100%;, for examples see Downers Grove, Willowick, Ohio, etc etc. Any ideas about where this came from, and how it can be addressed? It seems like a category generated as part of a marketing strategy. Novickas

every article published in Foreign Affairs is reviewed by other scientists, which is much more than you could say for any “reliable” newspaper or just about every university publication. That should be enough to make sure WP:ATT isn’t a good reason to ban them.
I have to agree with Ultramarine: if you use your interpretation of WP:ATT consequently, there’s only a handful of WP-articles that would survive the necessary mass-deletion of references. (What’s more, I think it would be some pretty bad ones, those that rely entirely on newspaper articles)

 a few suggestions on """"Measuring economic worth over time"""" 

I fully realize that this is a work in progress but thought a few suggestions could be useful. I'll post some specific ones on the talk page but more generally:

 Please don't take it the wrong way but I think quite often your writing style reflects academia too much - as if you were writing for an academic journal. However the intended target audience of the Wikipedia is different than that of a bunch of academics so care should be taken to avoid unnecessary nomenclature and jargon, as well as to avoid """"academic phrasing"""" in favor of simple formulations. More importantly I think one should be careful with introducing terms and concepts into the text that have not been defined previously and that a lay reader may be unfamiliar with, for example """"social cost"""" or """"social production"""".
 Speaking of """"social production"""" it'd be useful to standardize the terminology when it is being used. For example it seems like by """"proportions of social production"""" you refer to income shares of various classes (workers, capitalists, landlords etc) - if so, then that should be stated clearly, if not, the difference should be clarified. Likewise comparing the article title and the lead I think you're equivocating between """"economic worth"""" and """"social worth"""" which could be/are distinct concepts. Also because I'm probably coming at this from a different background I'm wondering what exactly is the relationship between """"social product"""" and more standard measures of production like GDP, income, etc.
 """"Both contemporary and historical wage price series are inherently controversial, as they speak to the standard of living of working class people."""" - I'm not sure if contemporary wage and price series are really """"inherently"""" controversial in the sense of being outright rejected by many researchers; at least that doesn't seem like the appropriate word here. Likewise, I don't think the reason why they are controversial/deemed important is because they concern """"working class people"""". They obviously concern all members of society whatever their class status. In a similar way the idea of """"economic worth"""" can refer to entities such as firms, charities, nations or even physical objects such as machinery and equipment.
 Proportion of gdp and the questions given as examples aren't really related. For example the question """"what was the opportunity cost of a £50,000 investment in 1840?"""" is not obviously or directly related to the question """"what was the social power of capital in 1840?"""".
 Some ideas for expansion: """"Theoretical problems"""" sections should link and perhaps briefly mention things like the LTV and marginalism, maybe something like the aggregation problem (though that article needs some serious work). """"Wage price series"""" can be expanded to include discussion of how these kind of data are generally collected (btw, I'm not sure what a """"real price"""" is here. An individual good price divided by a price index?). For historical wage price series there's also a good bit of data available for the Netherlands and to a lesser extent France and Germany. There's also sporadic data for a wide number of different societies which don't really constitute a series but do provide """"snapshot"""" views of the economy/society in time (all the way back to ancient Sumer). The main difficulty of comparing aggregates across time is the changing nature of a consumption basket and time usage, in particular introduction of new goods and disappearance of old ones (like Malleus alludes to above) - this should also be elaborated upon and made more explicit.

I'd really hate to barge in and edit a new article while it is still being written so I thought bringing up some suggestions here would be better. Thanks.  """,0

 Olympic 

Formation and early years
The name was chosen by James Edmondson, the club's first treasurer, and is believed to have been inspired by the recent excavation of Olympia, site of the ancient Olympic Games. It's referenced by Phythian, p. 7?
Yes, that's right    
Decline and colapse
In 1886 the club's committee was forced to reduce the players' wages to a quarter of what was being offered by Preston North End. Why it is comparing with the PNE? It's because some players went to play there?
Simply because PNE were the top club in the area.  It shows how much worse Olympic's wages were compared to the top club in the area.  Hope that makes sense    
Rivalries
The rivalry became especially fierce in September 1884, when, amid accusations that the clubs were using underhand tactics in attempts to """"poach"""" each others' star players, the Rovers' secretary sent a telegram to his opposite number stating that his club would play no matches against Olympic in the 1884–85 season.

"Background + Greco-Turkish War as an extension of the Balkan Wars 

I have tried to clean up the mess made by a number of edits which, while making some worthwhile points, also included assertions that were only marginally relevant or that provided excessive detail.  I removed some assertions and moved some to other articles leaving behind a summary.

One thing that we need to remember is that the focus of this article is the war itself and we need to ensure that the Background article does not grow to the point where it dominates the article and overwhelms the discussion of the war.  The reader should not have to slog through a long discussion of turn-of-the-century Greek and Balkan history before getting to the discussion of the war itself.

I know that I started this by introducing the discussion of the Megali Idea, Venizelos and Constantine I but I meant for the treatment to only cover a few paragraphs.  That is why I have been shortening the Background section back to more manageable proportions.

One thing that I am still wrestling with is the idea that this war was an extension of the Balkan Wars.  I can believe that this is true but I need a deeper understanding before I can figure out how to present the idea in a way that the reader can understand.

I have removed the image of people migrating as it seems not directly relevant to the argument.",0

 Spider Loc & Young Buck controversy 
Hey boss, what is the issue you have with the Spider Loc and Young Buck controversy that you keep deleting the entire paragraph after numerous users have updated and added content to it? Are you not recognizing the beef as factual? Check out Spider Loc's homepage or MySpace page or any one of a thousand websites (including MTV) that have covered the controversy.

Uchi-deshi
The new piece on notable uchi-deshi needs to be fleshed out.  

Biography
I would like to see the biography expanded a bit while avoiding style or author specific references.  It's a bit redundant when the points are made elsewhere - about 20% of Ueshiba's Biography was talking about Saito and Ueshiba's son each which have their own entries.  The links are adequet for finding the information.  

I expanded the biography being careful not to exclude information already there. 

 Would someone adress why in the section on Deguchi there is very little information on his encounter
 with the chinese army, I mention this because I believe the """"dodging balls of white light"""" story 
should be first in the section of """"awakenings """" 
that led to the roots of aikido. This story is very prevalent in aikdo literature 
and I wonder why it is not included.128.192.36.80  

 Soke Morihei Ueshiba 

I noticed that the """"Soke"""" is the name for """"founder of a style"""", (martial arts). Should Ueshibas article include this title?—Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs) 

Absolutely not.  Soke is a title used by some Japanese martial arts to refer to the founder or head but I have never heard the term used in Aikido.  In Japan Ueshiba M. is sometimes referred to as Kaiso which means founder and in fact this term is far more commonly used than O sensei which seems to be a Western affection.  I have actually run into Aikidoists mortally offended by another art using the term O sensei as if it somehow slights Ueshiba M..  Both Kaiso and O sensei tend to be used primarily within the Aikikai and its newer derivatives.  In the older styles it is much more common to just hear Ueshiba sensei but then again they do not have the confusion of familial succession.  Personally I would like to see O sensei removed from the articles orther than a mention that some Aikidoists refer to him as such but I think that would raise a few hackels. 

Hackles be dammed I reduced the number of O sensei's in the text and clarified its usage a tad. I have never heard one Japanese Shihan use the term O sensei while in Japan.  Not saying they don't just that its not common. 

Well it's fine by me. I only asked because I noticed Gozo Shioda is referred to as """"Soke Gozo Shioda"""" on the official Yoshinkan website. When I first saw it I figured that if Shioda had a """"Soke""""-title then Ueshiba should too. Oh, by the way, my own aikido club (Ki-aikido) usually just say """"Ueshiba sensei"""" or """"Ueshiba"""". I cant actually remember anyone using the phrase O-sensei other than in a few introductionary speeches.
 

Interesting point about Yoshinkan I am more familiar with them using the term Kancho but it is their choice. Perhaps they didn't use Kaiso as not to confuse Shioda with Ueshiba.  Soke would not be a wrong usage for either man just in the case of Ueshiba it was not the term used.  I am going to ask a Yoshinkan Honbu Instructor his opinion on this.  At Shodokan Honbu (Tomiki's dojo) it is always Ueshiba sensei and interestingly Tomiki is always refered to as either Shihan or sensei - no other titles.  In Ki society how is Tohei sensei refered to?  

Tohei? Well I suppose it's mostly just """"Tohei-sensei"""" and/or """"Tohei"""" for mentionings in day to day training. (to say Tohei without the """"-sensei"""" might sound disrespectful in Japan but it is not in Sweden )) As for the official, formal titles of both Koichi Tohei and Kenjiro Yoshigasaki I have no idea. My club belongs to the latters Ki no Kenkyukai Internationale organisation by the way.

At times the subject seems to have been suppressed by the science establishment either purposefully or just out of hubris, and anyone discussing the subject publicly ridiculed.  Either way it's """"flat-earth society"""" type behaviour that I find objectionable.

I understand your points but disagree, particularly on the notability aspect.  I can easily find scores of entries regarding subjects of less notability than The Resonance Project on Wikipedia.  I am suspicious of the motivation to so quickly suppress my expression of free speech in this so called """"community"""".  Instead of offering a chance for me to bring my article into compliance with Wikipedia standards you quickly deleted it, and by doing so silenced my opinions.  Thats wrong.  And although a comment made by another editor stated that I had a chance to contest the """"Speedy Deletion"""" I could find no such option.

When you have notability thresholds for a supposedly public community which rely on mainstream media to set the bar, and the mainstream media is owned and virtually controlled by a few select individuals and organizations with their own agendas, then you have a problem.  Wikipedia you have a problem, and if I can't get entries for """"Nassim Haramein"""" and """"The Resonance Project"""" in I am going to begin a campaign to discredit and inform of the corruption of Wikipedia, the not-so-""""free"""" encyclopedia. Wake up  Wikipedia editors...open your eyes and minds and be a force for good in the world, not another puppet.

This new field of spiritual science or Unified Physics, whatever you want to call it, is an important subject and needs to be represented in the sphere of social consciousness whether you agree with it or not.  There are thriving social media communities of 300,000+ individuals on both The Resonance Project and Hassim Harramein's Facebook pages, and yet Wikipedia via it's ignorant (sorry it's true) editors quickly dismiss as not notable.  It's notable enough for 300,000 people to include the information provided by Nassim Haramein and The Resonance Project in their social media feeds, who are you to dismiss so many people's opinions?  300,000 people think about that.

If I gather the neccessary information would you be willing to help me organize it in such a manner as to pass muster of the Wikipedia editorial drones?

 Weedpatch Camp 

Thanks for creating the article.

I had a feeling something was fishy about the location, and some extensive internet research finally revealed what (and where!) the real buildings were.

Carefully skim through and remove *anything* that is even slightly subjective praise that's not directly sourced to a review/commentator.

Creating a fuller """"Responses"""" section would be nice, but isn't a priority for me.

I agree with your assessment that """"it's hard to learn"""" is the biggest issue with NVC.  There's also no standardized curriculum for it, and the way it's taught is constantly evolving. 

When it comes to criticism, I wish there could be some distinction between criticizing the core ideas of NVC and criticizing Rosenberg's presentation of it. Though I suppose that's a hard distinction for outsiders to make. There are a few things that Rosenberg says that I don't agree with, or ways he says things that are exaggerated, perhaps to try to shock people into seeing things differently in a teaching context  but none of those are the core of NVC, and other trainers including myself present NVC in ways that don't include those elements that are easy to take exception to, yet which still capture all the core ideas.

Consider: suppose some reputable news source were to assert that in primary school one of his school friends noticed him wetting his pants on one occasion; we would object to such an item as being too non-encyclopaedic and non-notable for inclusion in WP, irrespective of whether the citation were from an unknown local rag or from the Times supported by affidavits. To justify inclusion presumed accuracy and verifiability are necessary, but not sufficient. The condom thing is a pretty ignominious basis for calling him an inventor, groupie stuff in short, but since it is marketed and patented, and possibly effective for all I know, go ahead; some readers might enjoy a snigger.

The current status of this bridge is vehicle and pedestrian traffic only. I am unsure if the bridge carried a trolley service (small) or full blown trains in the past. Currently, I doubt that full blown trains were utilized and smaller trolleys were potentially used, like the rest of Sacramento back in the 1920s. Given that the Central Pacific had a bridge just to the north, I doubt nothing larger than a trolley ran across this bridge.",0

calmer adresses to Jimbo, and have gotten zero results.

City of Vancouver or Greater Vancouver Area?

The classification box should read """"City of Vancouver"""" instead of simply """"Vancouver"""" since it appears to be the Wikipedia standard to use the """"official"""" name of any country, nation-state, American state, etc. in such classification boxes.  Further, I notice alot of articles about Vancouver's neighbouring municipalities that do not mention the official names of such municipalities.  Why simply say """"Delta"""" when one should be saying """"The Incorporation of Delta"""" when the government website of that municipality uses such as a legalistic title? I know that lawyers are the only type of people who really care about municipal boundaries and official names, but this is still Wikipedia and all the technical and legalistic details should be mentioned.  After all, municipalities, whether a city, town, township, village, etc., are merely creations of the law of incorporation.

I was wondering if any person living in the Greater Vancouver Area had a hand in writing this article because there is lack of distinction being made between the City of Vancouver (i.e. Vancouver proper) and the surrounding municipalities such as the City of Burnaby, City of Richmond, etc.  Until the Greater Vancouver Area undergoes the type of municipal amalgamations as seen in the Toronto, Ottawa and Hamilton areas, this important distinction must be made.  This article should not use the simple word """"Vancouver"""" to mean the larger metro area that includes Burnaby, Richmond, etc.  Doing so would be very confusing to a reader in view of the Greater Vancouver Area map with all those municipal boundaries drawn in.

I understand what you're saying, but this is not a disciplinary measure, it is further offence as an admin not only attacks my WQA response, but then conceals their attack by turning my behaviour into hyperbole to reduce their guilty. I don't apologise to people with such motives, or who serve protect themselves. The project only risks degenerating when sysop is left in the hands of people who abuse it. I maintain that the block is a front, a pretext. If reviewing admins are failing to take time to determine that and recognise the integrity of my claim, instead of taking Fram's for granted, which is contrary to """"we're all equals on wiki"""", then I will have no choice but to raise the matter elsewhere, such as RfC or ArbCom. This isn't about discipline, at my age I don't consider """"you can't login"""" as anything like you suggest, because it's not like losing wages. It's the principle of the matter. My contribs to WQA were meticulously used as spin against me, instead of the AGF everyone else saw them as. I don't intend to let Fram sit on a high horse any longer. Either they apologise first and withdraw their false assertions, or they'll have to explain them to RfC or ArbCom. Which I'm sure is much more complex and time consuming and stressful than admitting to any wrong-doing, but so be it, I stand for what I believe in and always have. I won't be bullied by someone like that. So really, the ball is in their court. If no one is counting coup, that applies to the admin who attacked me in an undignified manner, and continues to do so by maintaining their position – though now shielding themselves behind a wall of admins instead of facing up to the fact they erred. COI is clearly affecting their actions, or unwillingness to show face. They can either opt-in and admit they were wrong for their attack, or wait until a higher channel, one that even exceeds their stance, asks why they attacked my contribs and synthesised a despicable """"bad faith"""" conclusion.

"Invitation to workshops on Wikipedia editing
Dear Ploversegg,

We are a team of researchers at the University of Oxford and AU Sharjah, researching the experiences of editors of content about the Arab world on Wikipedia. We are interested in your experiences of editing Wikipedia and are organising two events that we think you would be an excellent contributor to.

First, starting next week on Monday 27th August, we are hosting an online discussion about what it is like to contribute to Wikipedia in Arabic and to articles about the Middle East and North Africa. We are interested in what barriers you perceive to exist in Wikipedia, how articles can be made better and generally what can be done to expand and improve Arabic Wikipedia. This discussion will take place on a MediaWiki hosted at our institution and be available in English and Arabic. We will allow users to create their own discussion pages in addition to our discussions.

Second, we are hosting face-to-face workshops in Cairo from 21st-22nd October 2012. If you are interested in this we may be able to pay your travel and accommodation costs depending on where you live. This workshop will cover similar themes to the online discussion but will allow participants to meet one another and benefit from being together.  

We will take care of the organization and planning and all you have to do is show up and be ready to discuss. But if you would like to help shape some of the discussion themes in advance, please let us know. We have booked time in the workshops for Wikipedian-led discussions.  

More details can be found in our “Frequently Asked Questions” section below. 

We would be delighted to welcome you to either (or both) event. Please let me know (wikiproject@oii.ox.ac.uk) if you would like to participate and we can send you more details.

Sincerely,

Mark, Bernie, Ilhem, Ali, Ahmed and Heather

Frequently Asked Questions:
 
What is the purpose of this project?

This project is about who represents the Arab World on Wikipedia, and how the Middle East and the Arab world is represented on Wikipedia. We are studying Wikipedia through statistics, edit  history data and personal experiences. Our ultimate goal is to help Wikipedia grow in size and fairness and do academic research on this topic. You can read more about the project here: http://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/research/projects/?id=70 From this page, you can also find a biography of the researchers. You may also want to see our interactive visualizations about Wikipedia here: http://wikiproject.oii.ox.ac.uk/ 

Who is funding this project?

This project is funded by the International Development Research Centre (http://www.idrc.ca). This organization is funded by the Canadian government to improve infrastructure across the world, including online content. We have been working with the IDRC since June 2010. 

Why did you contact me?

Because you’re awesome. In all seriousness, we have been looking through Wikipedia for active editors based on user activity in either Arabic Wikipedia or articles about the Arab world. We have not contacted everyone we could, but we contact people that we think will help to balance the discussion and help us (and each other) learn more about the state of Wikipedia.  

Do I need to participate in both events?

Not at all. You are welcome to participate in both or just one. We recognise that it will be more convenient for some people to have online conversations and for others to speak in person. For some people it will not be practical to fly to the Middle East, but we still consider their contributions important and want to give them a voice in this work.

Can I use my Wikipedia handle in the online discussion?

You do not need to use any particular name on the online forum. All we need is a valid email address so you can register. You can post using your real name, your Wikipedia name or a completely different nickname, whatever allows you to speak your mind most effectively. 

What sort of travel funding will you supply for the face-to-face workshop?

We have funding for travel and accommodation costs for approximately twenty participants depending on where they are coming from. If you would like to join us in one of the face-to-face meetings then we wi",0

Honestly, that was not """"threats of harassment"""", maybe it sounds like it... but you don't know about the actual situation and what happened in the past. GVnayR is a very """"dangerous"""" Wikipedian, I can deepen it.

Sadly, blocking this user Hydao (who always fought against vandalism and addition of nonsense things) will not solve the problem. Sooner, the user GVnayR will start adding completely stupid and nonsense things on Wikipedia, which is unacceptable. I will continue fighting against vandalism and nonsense stuff (added by losers/nolifers like GVnayR), with or without """"Hydao"""". Now you are thinking: """"Hydao, you are insulting a user by calling """"loser and no-lifer"""", but that's not an insult, it's just the reality.

Hi, I am Mishae, I would like to know if the indefinite block of user You have no nipples was fair. I'm not an admin, but maybe it would have been better to put him under topic ban instead? Not to mention, your block came after a warning, after which he didn't edit that or any other article. I personally invited him to WikiProject Pornography after seeing his sandbox. Regards,  
Since all that user's edits were obvious vandalism, including the sandbox, and the username further suggests an intention not to contribute constructively to the encyclopedia, this was a routine block (the kind that the template  is regularly used to deal with). Regards,   (Edgar181) 
O.K, but don't you need to give a user a last warning before you block him/her? Not to mention, in sandbox a user have a right to write what he wants as long as he is not attacking anyone and it doesn't get out.  
There is no requirement in the blocking policy for a """"last warning"""" before a user can be blocked. And there are other types of inappropriate content in a user's sandbox than just attacks on other users (and it doesn't matter if it """"gets out"""" or not either).    (Edgar181) 
O.K. By last warning I ment this. He wasn't attacking other users just writing nipples and You have no nipples (in the very end). Is it dumb? Yes. Either way, if he will get unblocked feel free to give me a ping, and I will sent him to adoption.  

Ironically, I'm unhappy that  was not indeffed, as they've only ever pushed their POV, and they've had enough warnings (edit-summary based, and one on their talk page), and a prior block, yet haven't contributed anything anywhere else.  (tell Luke off here)

(ec) I guess I didn't realize that the disruptive edits at Coventry City F.C. were their entirely of contributions to Wikipedia.

 Article Feedback Tool update 

Hey Edgar181. I'm contacting you because you're involved in the Article Feedback Tool in some way, either as a previous newsletter recipient or as an active user of the system. As you might have heard, a user recently anonymously disabled the feedback tool on 2,000 pages.  We were unable to track or prevent this due to the lack of logging feature in AFT5.  We're deeply sorry for this, as we know that quite a few users found the software very useful, and were using it on their articles.

We've now re-released the software, with the addition of a logging feature and restrictions on the ability to disable. Obviously, we're not going to automatically re-enable it on each article—we don't want to create a situation where it was enabled by users who have now moved on, and feedback would sit there unattended—but if you're interested in enabling it for your articles, it's pretty simple to do. Just go to the article you want to enable it on, click the """"request feedback"""" link in the toolbox in the sidebar, and AFT5 will be enabled for that article.

Again, we're very sorry about this issue; hopefully it'll be smooth sailing after this ). If you have any questions, just drop them at the talkpage. Thanks!

It was not a personal attack, but rather a racist remark about Indians in general. No, I did not accuse Anir1uph of being unfamiliar with the English language because he is Indian, his nationality was irrelevant. Anir1uph showed failure to use the English language correctly, common practice among non-native English speakers. I am fed up with uneducated third world citizens who edit Wikipedia according to their own POV. Anir1uph is a pretentious editor and forms fart of a larger Indian demographic who subtly edit Wikipedia pushing their own POV, using weasel words and do not adhere to consensus. There is a growing concern among a considerable number of White Western editors that due to the increased availability of computers and the internet around the world - the number of uneducated third world citizens with a POV agenda to their edits is rising rapidly. Nationalism is a large factor in this and it isn't healthy for the Wikipedia community. There is an ongoing clash of culture and outlooks, Asians view the world differently than Europeans and North Americans. In my opinion the sooner editors are restricted to editing Wikipedia in their native tongue the better.

"(reset indent) Ignore policy? You can't even point us to the relevant policy! Nonetheless, how could Wiki possibly decide an article that has a criticism section could be a Featured Article? Controversial subject? PETA? Really? - list all the controversial items for me please. 

I did not ignore your response; I thought my answer was clear  but I'll ride the donkey for ya. 
 A single section containing criticisms is an example of a poorly structured article as it means that people reading about a subject have to look in the section about it for the 'non-criticism' and then a second section to see if there is any criticism. This is a statement to which I have refuted wholly by showing you an example of an article that is not porrly (rather, superbly) written; also, the criticism section does nothing but DESCRIBE the criticism involved with the topic (eg. why/how/what re criticism of the Canadian Charter...) See?
Naming a section 'Criticisms' or something similar is giving Wikipedia a POV. Specious. We wish to DESCRIBE the criticisms, not create them. We therefore need a section do do so. (I concur, though; forking is counter-productive. Man you got a little pet name for everything.)
*...such a section is normally just a troll magnet and POV magnet, making things difficult to manage. First, that is tantamount to cutting off your nose to spite your face: crappy articles because a good one would attract undue attention? That's silliness. Moreover, good articles are far less likely to be attacked by vandals. And lastly, protect the pages once well-written - don't make drivel out of the article just because writing it correctly (i.e., like the featured articles) would attract attention. Change the management method instead.

On top of all that, I submit that this PETA/AR debacle is so controversial for no other reason than that the articles are poorly written. They are biased, they are agenda-driven, they lack recognition (DESCRIPTION) of criticisms and they are quite obviously over-protected and coddled over by people who truly don't want criticism to see the light of day. 

Now, please list all the controversial items re PETA for me please.",0

"Claims that family of Lazar Kolisevski had Bulgarian ethnicity

When someone claims for a Macedonian person to be a Bulgarian, is an offense to the Macedonians, similar or worse when someone calls Bulgarian a Tatar. Kolisevski has always stated he has a Macedonian ancestry.
He had done a lot to stop the Bulgarian Nationalistic Propaganda, that claims a lot of aspects about Macedonian Nation to be Bulgarian.
These views do not exists in reality. These views are coming from the 19th century Romantic movement of the new Balkan nations, like Serbia, Bulgaria and Greece. After they got independent from the Ottoman Empire in the 19th century, and Macedonia being under the Ottoman rule until early 20th century, all of these neighboring nations had assimilation policies towards the people living in Macedonia. The fruit of this policies were the first and second Balkan Wars when the territory of Macedonia was taken over from the Ottoman Empire and divided between these neighboring countries. And according to the new rulers of these territories, they were inhabited by Serbs, Bulgarians and Greeks.
Bulgaria got the smallest part, which was the reason for starting the Second Balkan War.
These policies truly belong to the past and should rest in peace there.

Erm, to clarify, I didn't say that Punic and Greek warships can be handled together as Hellenistic warships, I merely said that they are usually handled together as belonging to the same chapter in maritime technology. You can check Meijer, the Cambridge history, Casson or Morrison and Coates. In all of them, the warships of the 4th to 1st centuries BC are handled together, whether they were of Punic or Greek type, which is quite natural, as explained above. For the Hellenistic , I agree it is not very accurate, but Morrison at least has written a chapter """"Hellenistic Oared Warships, 399–31 BC"""" in AGE OF THE GALLEY in which he includes both Western and Eastern Mediterranean ships. Perhaps a more accurate title for our article would be """"Hellenistic-era warships"""" which emphasizes the period and not the culture?

 Orlando """"Jonathan Blanchard"""" Bloom 

I anyone tries to add this back, here's the story. Back in 2005 or so, my roomate (Jonathan Blanchard, or as we call him Jo) had pretty long hair and his then girlfriend called him Jorlando Bloom, as a general funny/derogatory insult. It pissed him off and we started to call him that for a while. Apparently one of us got on Wikipedia and vandalised the page . About two days ago, he found out, and thought I recently vandalized the page, but we checked the history and it turned out to date from March 2005. That's nearly 4 years ago! Then  added a reference for this , probably in good faith, but for the various biographical details (date of birth, etc...). 

So now you have a ton of mirrors and sources that based themselves on this Wikipedia article, saying that Orlando Bloom's full name is Orlando Jonathan Blanchard Bloom. Hell, even the disambiguation page was affected , again probably in good faith (and then reverted a few days ago, by my roomate ).

I'll try to get something of value on these guys together this weekend. I remember having an attempt back when they were first registered with the AEC, but I had a lot of difficulty working out exactly what their relationship with the CDP was (they seem to be what used to be the Victorian branch of the CDP, with possibly several others, still affiliated with them somehow). Hopefully there's some more info around now, especially with this by-election in the works. (I had a look at the by-election page and fixed up the candidates table a little - it was listing candidates of the Democrats, Secular Party and SEP, none of which are registered in Victoria. I have noticed, though, that Antony has started listing unregistered parties in much the same way as registered ones, so this will be worth keeping an eye on in the future.)

Jayjg, is there any edit to this article you would accept? What are your objections to clarifying ethnic vs. religious definitions of """"Jews""""? The article is currently confusing as to which is which, and it would help to clarify that JfJ means ethnic Jews. I think in the case Mackan points out, """"many"""" is appropriately used-many Jewish groups do see JfJ that way, but certainly not all (I would imagine there are plenty of Jewish groups without any official position on JfJ.) Also, most religions are rather fluid and change over time, and there is often debate over interpretation. It is, therefore, not quite so easy to state religious principles as fact (Jews don't believe in Jesus as Messiah? What about Messianic Judaism?) Of course, religious faith also tends to be given over to a lot of dogmatism (""""my way is the correct one"""" type of thinking), so sometimes it's difficult to see debates to that as valid. WP:WEASEL does not object to ever using """"many"""" or """"most"""" or the like as qualifiers, it advocates against it only in the absence of sourcing. What we have here is a lot of sourcing, which does not, however, show that all Jews object to JfJ (as I explained above, that would be effectively impossible). It does, of course, show that """"many"""" do (I wouldn't even object to """"almost all"""" or """"most""""), but in order to preserve the plausibility requirement of WP:NPOV (JfJ's assertion that it is Jewish must be treated as plausible), it is impossible that all Jewish organizations disagree-as JfJ doesn't!

"Bangladesh Law Minister's criticisms regarding Drishtipat

The reason we have cited the report regarding the Bangladeshi Law Ministers comments about Drishtipat's partiality toward the Awami League is because Drishtipat themselves [] put the Law Ministers comments and their response together under the heading ' Drishtipat response to the law minister's allegation' on their site. If the organisation itself felt criticised and responded, then it is hardly controversial to presume that it was Drishtipat that the Law Minister was talking about. I'm sure Drishtipat knew their own position and intentions better than the moderator (Ragib) on Wikipedia!

Besides in Bangali politikospeak, the governing party of the day rarely criticises an opponent by name. For example, when the BNP were in power, they would use oblique language like 'a certain party is causing violence in Bangladesh' with reference to hartals. Everyone would read between the lines and know that they are criticising their main opponents the Awami League. It's hardly rocket science. 

It is therefore reasonable as a citation of the governments position and the Law Minister also expanded on the reasons eg. partisan reporting re: government achievements.",0

"My edits
I rewrote somewhat to avoid a combining of the traditions of different parts of Polynesia. I also tried to change the emphasis in the opening line to Pulotu as 'Polynesian mythology' which gives the mistaken impression that the concept is found all over Polynesia. It is important to maintain the separation of the individual traditions - otherwise we are at risk of rewriting the traditions. The association made with the Māori concepts of Hawaiki and Te Reinga I thought was taking it a little too far - Hawaiki is not always/often conceived of that way by my people. I also took out a reference to 'Purotu' since there was no evidence offered that the word occuring in that form means underworld. I also took out the reference to Pulotu having changed in Tahitian to purotu meaning a girl of marrying age. The word occurs in many Eastern Polynesian languages with the meaning beautiful:

HAW   Puuloku. Comely, tender (Pki)@
MAO   Purotu. Handsome, clear, pleasant (Wms)@
MVA   Porotu. Beauty, handsome person (Bck)@

 Blocked 

 I can not even imagine how petty and arogant someone must be to block someone that has contributed so much to wikipedia in the past because of a very minor technicality. Although I assume it would be easy for him to abide by your request, there must be a reason he does not. It is because of people like this blocker that chase off very valuable members of our editorial community. He may not be appealing because of the disgust he has, related to wikipedia's emboldening of power to some that can not seem to see the value in a very capable and knowledgeable contributor.  

 Is there a way for me to appeal to someone with higher authority on Handicapper's behalf?  
Feel free to start a discussion at WP:ANI, however, you really should familiarize yourself with all the facts before you go throwing accusations around.  dude?/dude. 

 edgar flores 

the information i edited comes from my personal relationship with the living person.
all published sources that your information comes from are no longer accurate.
i checked the BLP page and the verifiability standard makes the edits i am trying to put through difficult to impossible.
because you are a far more experienced editor, i ask you: how do we work through this impasse?
  
Unfortunately, what you're describing is original research, which is against Wikipedia policies  especially in regards to biographies of living people.  So, you'll have to find a published, reliable source that has this information in it to add it to the article.  Finally, it sounds like you have a clear conflict of interest, so you may wish to avoid the article altogether. dude?/dude.

To say that they approached the topic with skepticism is to imply that they literally considered the possibility that this truly was a time traveler. That itself is a POV.

We laugh and then forget the jokes the next day, in my opinion. Orson Welles' """"War of the Worlds"""" broadcast is notable because (amongst other things) of the widespread panic that it caused by people who literally believed it to be a reliable news item. I don't think that any of these people """"went along with the fun, wink wink, nudge nudge, and fled their homes just for the snicker bragging rights"""". No such notable hysteria came of this story, as I had already shown that since the initial flash in the pan 2 months ago this has been mentioned only once by any news source.

Hello, young chap

Thanks for the info. I still believe that when quoting someone - and still more when quoting a legal text - one should keep the text exactly as it is (except for evident typos). Neither Vietnamese nor modern English (nor modern French - but we write Hanoi and Saigon) use hyphens for Vietnamese names, but an original text is an original text. Will you translate de Négrier's quotes into """"jeune de banlieue"""" slang to please the Wikipedia thought police? Will you replace Tourane, Cap Padaran, Poulo-Cécir de mer, etc. by modern names? Will you talk about the Ho Chi Minh City Treaties of 1862 and 1874? Use modern English in the text, not in the quotes! Hope you hear my great-grandfather making bubbles behind me - he is furious that you dare change a text he spent so much time drafting and re-drafting to get the Nguyễn Văn Tường scoundrel swallow it pour la plus grande gloire de la France et de sa mission civilisatrice.

 By the way, I modified the """"Vietnam"""" part of Jules Patenotre des Noyers (no ô because of the primitive anglo-saxon keyboards). I will develop the """"China"""" part later.

 By another way, I wonder what is this book you often quote: Thomazi, Auguste  « Histoire militaire de l’Indochine française »  Hanoi, 1931. I know (but I do not have - it is too expensive) Aubert (général) et Pasquier, P. (1930), « Histoire militaire de l'Indochine française, des débuts à nos jours (juillet 1930) établie par des officiers de l'Etat-major du général de division Aubert, commandant supérieur des troupes du Groupe de l'Indochine», Hanoi et Haiphong, juillet 1930, 2 vol, 232 + 306 pp. As far as I know, Thomazi has nothing to do with it.

By a third way, I noticed that your real name appears at the top of your dicussion page.

By a fourth way, Liu Yongfu is coming slowly (I have put the draft on my French page, but it disappeared).

Show 'n' Tell

A question for   It may seem an odd question to WP purists, but considering the importance WP places on reliability of secondary sources, why does WP not require a same or similar vetting process of its editors, particularly those who seem to speak only for themselves?  The entire concept of requiring contributors to discuss/argue with a username is absurd in its most basic interpretation.  For all I know, I could be spinning my wheels fighting for accuracy with a demented, mind game-playing geek living in inner Mongolia.  It is imperative, in my mind, that those who demand respect offer up some sort of evidence, as I have, of their actual ability, credibility, reliability, accountability...  their authority to control.  If it's required of the sources, it should certainly be required of those who quote them and write about them.  Similarly, how do I """"call for consensus?""""  Who may be a member and how is each identified?  Thanks in advance...

"Proposed move would benefit the wider community (a copy in my talk page). 

Wikipedia is not a dictionary but an encyclopedia, therefore, the content and title name of an article there, necessarily needs to be encyclopedic, not as in the case of dictionaries. The naming of the sweet cannot straightforwardly choose as Rasgulla. However, the naming in Wikipedia appears to be followed only the Oxford dictionaries, as an anglicize name loaned from a foreign country. But the name obviously misspelled there, as the dictionary mentions rasgullā originates in Hindi – so the name to be disambiguated to avoid confusion with Rosogolla for the reasons many reliable English-language sources mentions the sweet name Rosogolla, The Oxford Companion to Sugar and Sweets describes Rosogolla is primarily associated with West Bengal, then Bengal in British India. The fact establishes the origin of the sweet is in Bengal - a part of greater India, not Hindi, in Bengal the sweet is called Rosogolla since its initial usage.  
 
Nevertheless, here rises a question, whether Wikipedia must stick to its current naming when the naming is misleading or inaccurate. 

As per description of Wikipedia, the naming the sweet should be seen as goals, not as rules. Whereas, considering the deleted article Rosogolla's naturalness, consistency, prevalence in many reliable English-language sources, as well as its usage around 250 million Bengali people in Bangladesh, West Bengal, other states in India and world over, the name Rosogolla has come into majority use. The Oxford Companion to Sugar and Sweets highlights Rosogolla, and describes often-spelled Rasgulla, it is a very new edition published in the United Kingdom and the US. The name Rosogolla has been preferred in several publications in United Kingdom and the US. Some of these books are (1) Milk - Beyond the Dairy: Proceedings of the Oxford Symposium on Food... by Harlan Walke, Page 58. (2) Strategic Management: Formulation, Implementation and Control, by PEARCE, Page 179. (3) Food Culture in India, by Colleen Taylor Sen. There are too many reliable English sources in United Kingdom and the US those mention the sweet as Rosogolla. A confusing entry in the Oxford dictionaries cannot really overlook Rosogolla’s merit as a title name from the reliable English-language sources.

Therefore, my goal is to move the article [Rasgulla]] to Rosogolla and the move would benefit a wider community.",0

Ah yes of course, now I see it.  Sobran wasn't fired for being anti-Semitic, he was fired because he choose to speak the truth rather than let himself be silenced by the Jewish masters of capital who exercise undue control over the media and hollywood.  When other libertarians called for free trade and  freedom, Joseph Sobran stood up and told the working people of this country the truth, that American Jews were making money off their hard work and using it to support the country where their true loyalties lay, Israel...that Jewish invention that they use the supposed """"Holocaust"""" as an excuse for.  The mighty Sobran refused to believe in this Holocaust hoax either.  An invention of the Jewish propagandists..much like the material they churn out of Hollywood!

 Wikipedia and copyright 
 Hello Jbeck8924, and welcome to Wikipedia. Your addition to 401 Derby has had to be removed, as it appears to have added copyrighted material without permission from the copyright holder. While we appreciate your contributing to Wikipedia, there are certain things you must keep in mind about using information from your sources to avoid copyright or plagiarism issues here.

You can only copy/translate a small amount of a source, and you must mark what you take as a direct quotation with double quotation marks ("""") and a cited source. You can read about this at Wikipedia:Non-free content in the sections on """"text"""". See also Help:Referencing for beginners, for how to cite sources here.
Aside from limited quotation, you must put all information in your own words and structure, in proper paraphrase. Following the source's words too closely can create copyright problems, so it is not permitted here; see Wikipedia:Close paraphrasing. (There is a college-level introduction to paraphrase, with examples, hosted by the Online Writing Lab of Purdue.) Even when using your own words, you are still, however, asked to cite your sources to verify information and to demonstrate that the content is not original research. 
Our primary policy on using copyrighted content is Wikipedia:Copyrights. You may also want to review Wikipedia:Copy-paste. 
If you own the copyright to the source you want to copy or are a designated agent, you may be able to license that text so that we can publish it here. However, there are steps that must be taken to verify that license before you do. See Wikipedia:Donating copyrighted materials.
In very rare cases (that is, for sources that are public domain or compatibly licensed), it may be possible to include greater portions of a source text. However, please seek help at the help desk before adding such content to the article. 99.9% of sources may not be added in this way, so it is necessary to seek confirmation first. If you do confirm that a source is public domain or compatibly licensed, you will still need to provide full attribution; see Wikipedia:Plagiarism for the steps you need to follow.

For reference I quote (with added emphasis) from Wikipedia:Five pillars about WP:NPOV:
Wikipedia has a neutral point of view, which means we strive for articles that advocate no single point of view. Sometimes this requires representing multiple points of view; presenting each point of view accurately; providing context for any given point of view, so that readers understand whose view the point represents; and presenting no one point of view as """"the truth"""" or """"the best view"""". It means citing verifiable, authoritative sources whenever possible, especially on controversial topics.

 'Self-immolation' article 

I have experienced all manner of wikilawyering, hostility and disruption possible at the Falun Gong pages, which has turned me away as a potential sympathiser. I have officially retired from editing those articles, having concluded that it is pointless for me to continue there - Wikipedia seems all too tolerant of conflicted-out editors and disruptive point-pushers, by not banning  indefinitely. As I was the leading editor which got the 'self-immolation' article to FA, I felt closer to that article and thus decided to revisit it recently; I reserve my continue to do so from time to time, without feeling that I have violated any self-imposed 'retirement'. However, I do not intend on contributing to the ongoing discussion there. I hope that you will abide by my wish not copy my post across.

The fundamental problem I see is that the FLG practitioners appear to exist in a rarefied atmosphere of their alternate paradigm - like many Chinese, they subscribe to fatalism that everything is intended or planned by powerful forces. They cannot accept that independent acts of free will can occur, nor can they accept that any PRC source can be legitimately cited, because they are not reliable. The table which is currently subject to debate has been the target of removal by Dilip some time in the past, on the grounds that it was propaganda. By my reckoning, the table is carefully cited and attributed, and all the information therein belongs there. Just apply the same benchmark to any other piece of information there (such as name and occupation), and you will see that the practitioners' wanting to remove mentions that they may have been practitioners is wholly inconsistent bullshit, and an attempt at censorship. 

I believe the article was, at the time it was declared FA, materially compliant with WP:NPOV. It was in a very delicate state of balance, with neither side having the overall conclusion or last word, and with the readers being more or less able to decide for themselves what probably occurred. It has already been knocked off balance by those SPAs, who cannot tolerate any possibility, however remote, that practitioners may have been involved. What those editors want, IMHO, is completely at odds with the fundamental tenets of WP. They will work tirelessly to chip away at all those bits of text they find objectionable, so that a one-sided article exonerating Falun Gong will emerge over a period of time if vigilant editors like you are not around to challenge what they are doing - using a loose definition of the word. I just know I'm mentally exhausted from fighting them over the years.  ¡digame! """,0

 Effective Steps of Pearls 

I laugh in the face of danger..

Pearls are the only life embodiment gemstones. How to Beat It? GHD White can Help You Make It! Even though peals live longer than people, after the oxidation over years, they will grow yellow from white and slowly lose their luster. This is why there is an idiom of “one getting old like the pearl becoming yellow"""".What is the Future of Excitingly Attractive GHD uk ? God Knows!

In daily life, pearl cannot contact with perfume, oil, salt, alcohol, hair cream, vinegar, and dirt, much less contact with bananas, water and other organic solvents. Furthermore, it is unsuitable to wear the pearl necklace in the most sweating season – summer.

If you don't use them, you can clean them lightly by high level neuter soap or cleanser essence, and leave them to dry completely.It shouldn't be exposed to the sun.

The hardness of pearl is lower, if when the pearl turns to yellow and loses its luster, you can use available from 1% to 1.5% of hydrogen peroxide to bleach, be careful not to bleach too far, otherwise it will lose its luster.

You'd better clean it by sheepskin or delicate flannelette and then you can put it away after wear pearl each time. Do not use the surface paper, because the friction of some paper will wear the pearl.

Don’t use water for cleaning either, because water can enter the holes and will be hard to dry, also, it might make the pearls ferment inside and turn the line into green.

When you wear out a lot of sweat, wet towels can be used carefully and put it back to jewelry box back after natural drying. Occasionally, clean it by fresh-saline water, and keep the moist of pearl.

Only give yours pearl accessories best care, they can bloom the most dazzling gloss.""",0

Hello

I noticed that you have wrote on my talk page. I do know the user McFly85 personally. We both were in a computer lab checking out wikipedia one time and we talked about how the quality of certain areas of articles were a little lacking. He also told me about his tattered history on wikipedia, where he had his user page edited, without consent, by SWD316/Moe Epsilon. Then, someone else vandalized SWD316's user page, and put the blame on mcfly, which I'm fairly sure he would not do. Mcfly did make a few other accounts during a RFA as he was worried that if SWD316 would be given moderator powers, that he would be unfairly banned. And if you look at Mcfly85's edit history, he has made a wealth of good edits, mainly proofreading issues, but also a lot with NPOV, stub sorting, and even creating an article every once in awhile. In my opinion, even with all the alleged sockpuppet abuse, mcfly85 has been a strong asset to wikipedia. If it wasn't for this user, as lot of previous errors and formatting mistakes would have gone unnoticed, and would harm the quality of this site. He had no intention of becoming a moderator, but always intended to improve, even if only slightly, any article that was lacking quality. I feel bad that the actions of Moe Elipson have pretty much caused mcfly, my friend, to lose trust in this site and he has since retired his name. He did come back under another name, and made some great edits, but then, was unfairly (IMO) banned for being a 'sockpuppet used abusively"""". There is a difference between being a sockpuppet and trying to use a new name to get a fresh start.

But I am not mcfly85. I am fairly new to being a serious editor on wikipedia, and I was just checking some various parts of the site. I then noticed on the RFAs section that this familiar name came up, and I saw mcfly's screenname in the questions answered by Moe Elpison. I really didn't want other users have what happened to mcfly happen to them, so I voted opposed, which I am allowed to do as a user. I do not feel that I """"unfairly influenced"""" the voters, I think the voting results would have been the same weather I had voted or not. And I have never heard of Araxen, and I did not create or am involved with that user. That vote should not have counted. 

I just wanted to explain my case to you. I also question that Moe Elipson's user page may be in violation of the no personal attacks policy. He calls McFly85 some very harsh names, such as a stalker. I think that content that bashes other users should be removed, there is no place for that anywhere. But thanks for asking, I hope to keep making solid contibutions to the encyclopedia, it's a fun hobby.  """,0

"""== Literal text ==
I have changed """"According to the literal text of the constitution, the Governor-General is the representative of the Queen of Australia."""" to refer to Queen Victoria instead. I did this to make a point and that point is that the literal text of the Constitution cannot be taken as an unfailingly reliable guide to either practice or law.

Read the Constitution and you will find no mention of the Prime Minister, who is undeniably the head of government, even if one might imagine that this position is occupied by the Governor-General from a cursory reading of the Constitution. The Constitution declares that there shall be an Inter-State Commission, but the truth is that this body does not exist.

Please, if you refer to the literal text of the Constitution, either stick to the literal text and refrain from inserting material that does not belong - you will search in vain for the title """"Queen of Australia"""", for example - or qualify it by referring to documents and events such as the Royal Style and Titles Act 1953 where the title """"Queen of Australia"""" was introduced.  23:44, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Skyring - It is interesting how your own comments can be used to demonstrate how you add your own point of view - """"I did this to make a point!"""". A point about """"literal"""" text is make by using the adjective """"literal"""". Your point belongs elsewhere.

Anyway, the literal text does not mention """"Queen Victoria"""" it mentions the """"Queen"""". It further states that the """"Name of the King or Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for the time being is to be substituted from time to time"""". This is what I has done. Maybe, there is a more accurate way of making this subtitution, but """"Queen Victoria""""! That's wrong, wrong, wrong!

Is it? Have you checked the original? I think that you will find that instead of checking, you jumped in with some more untruths. Please think instead of responding when I press your buttons.  21:50, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)

I notice you haven't responded to this. Have you checked the original? This is in Parliament House, and is on public didplay.  00:04, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Yes I have checked: www.foundingdocs.gov.au

""""Not found The page you requested is not available at this address."""" I suggest you check the original. I have.  00:29, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Rather than just jump in and make changes after 15 seconds thought, go back have a think for serveral days before you start adding stuff like this!. It just wastes time. Also, when you say """"Please!"""", """"Read the constitution"""", you are showing contempt for others. 
 01:02, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)

When someone makes an obvious mistake like saying the literal text of the Constitution refers to the Queen of Australia, then I am quite justified in asking that person to read it.  21:50, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)

If you refer to the """"literal text"""" of the Constitution you will have to concede that it contains no reference to a """"Queen of Australia,"""" and that is because the thought of Australia as a state separate from the British Empire would have been quite foreign to the men who wrote the Constitution.  01:56, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)

I explained the substitution logic above and applied it. Then skyring put in """"Queen Victoria"""" !!! So I reduced it to just just """"Queen"""" (ie no substiution.) I have no problem either way.  11:56, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Let's stick with the Queen, shall we? That's probably the best bet.  21:50, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)

I thought the point about literal text had been made, but I see that it has not been appreciated. The Constitution does not state that the Governor-General is the representative of the Queen. If you want to quote the literal text of the Constition, then by all means do so, but don't go making stuff up that you think might or should or could be in there, when it clearly isn't.  23:49, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Nowhere in the literal text of the Constitution will you find the statement """"the Governor-General is the representative of the Queen"""". Nowhere. s2 states """"A Governor-General appointed by the Queen shall be Her Majesty's representative"""". That is a clear statement of intention. I noted s101 previously, which states: """"There shall be an Inter-State Commission"""". There is not an Inter-State Commission, so clearly it is incorrect to say that the literal text of s2 means that the Governor-General is now the Queen's representative, given the example",0

Particularly in the case of Krishnamurti, with whom Leadbeater was accused of child rape, it would seem impolitic to associate them in this article without some acknowledgment that there were difficult issues.  After all, Mrs Besant lost her own children in a not-dissimilar way to the circumstances under which Krishnamurti's parents lost him.  I met and talked to Krishnamurti in 1969 in connection with a film at his compound in Santa Barbara, California, and brought up the subject of Leadbeater.  He told me in no uncertain terms, and with uncharacteristic ill-temper, that he would never discuss that man.  All of this has been a point of public discussion for some time, and I wonder if there ought to be a further unearthing of sources for an article that associates Mrs Besant, Mr Leadbeater, and Krishnamurti.  kentfx",0

It arrives in America with the emigration of groups like the Saxons of Missouri and Grabau's group in Western New York. Folk like F.C.D.

""":Editors,

Thank you for the quick replies! My original thoughts were that it's painfully obvious to any reader that the UK is a country, and that this does not need pointing out  an equivalent example:

""""The United States is a country consisting of fifty states and a federal district.""""
can be reduced, without loss of clarity, to
""""The United States consists of fifty states and a federal district.""""

But very well  I can see that it's been decided to emphasize the UK's status as a country. Fair enough.

GoodDay, Jamesinderbyshire:  You're both very right, of course, but I think there's a chance we could preserve these subtle complexities AND use clear language *at the same time*. Perhaps there is a synonym for country that we can use that would eliminate this awkward wording altogether? I noticed that the """"Four countries of the United Kingdom"""" article uses the term """"sovereign state"""". Would the following work?

""""It is a sovereign state consisting of four countries: England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales.""""

Alarics: I realize the issue has been discussed before, but I feel that the issue has often been tackled from a political perspective - with pro-devolution/independence editors wanting to de-emphasize UK's status as a unitary state and with nationalists wanting to do the opposite.

I am a Canadian reader, without a lot of knowledge about UK politics or how the country operates. I am approaching this issue purely from a writing/editing perspective. I am simply trying to make this article as *clear and concise* as possible, without losing all the subtle complexities and compromises that various editors have negotiated into the article. I'm certainly not trying to set any new conventions, and I certainly don't want to set off any edit wars.

"This article confuses several different types of anti-personnel ammunition - originally called 'shrapnel' (after its inventor), 'grape' and 'cannister'.  Shrapnel and cannister seem to have been mainly land service ammunition while 'grape' seems to have been mainly naval.

Shrapnel was invented circa 1800, but later that century it was used with more modern shaped shells.  A shrapnel shell is like a flying shotgun, the bullets are ejected while the shell is in flight by a small charge and they fly forwards in a cone.  The charge is initiated by a time fuze (igniferious at this period)in the shell's nose, which is blown clear as the bullets leave.  Bullet sizes varied, but by WW1 they were usually lead antimony alloy with a few hundred bullets per pound weight.

Cannister, in contrast, is bullets in a can and the can bursts as it is fired.  This means cannister is short range.  While shrapnel was little used in WW2, cannister was developed for various weapons including tanks.  Australian Centurion tanks in Vietnam had 20-pdr cannister.

Cannister was always carried by British artillery in its 19th century campaigns and quite widely used. Sometimes it had to be locally assembled from old bully-beef cans. Shrapnel remained their primary anti personnel weapon into WW1, and always the ammunition of choice against 'troops in the open'. In 1945 they successfully trialled 95mm shrapnel fuzed VT.

Beehive, correctly called Splintex, was developed by the US in the Vietnam period.  It is a shrapnel type shell - it is fitted with a mechanical time fuze and the flechettes are fired forward from the shell in flight. It was available for 105mm arty, 106mm RCL, 90mm RCL, and probably others.  US policy was for splintex to be only fired at direct fire, ie for arty it was local defence only, presumably for fear of blinds being re-cycled by the enemy into IEDs.  However, the USSR appears to have subsequently developed 122mm and 152mm shells of this type and used them for indirect fire.",0

I think the pic of a 1979 Austin Allegro is actually a Vanden Plas either 1500 or 1750 model. You can tell by the raised grille attached to the bonnet - the VP was a luxury (sic) version of the Allegro mark 2 model produced between 1975 and 1979. It had a classic wood and leather interior including walnut picnic tables recessed into the backs of the front seats, and the different frontal treatment you can see hints of in the pic. The VP was something of a freak - who was it aimed at in marketing terms and did anyone ever associate Allegros with luxury motoring? It was probably produced because Ford was having big success with the Ghia versions of some of its models, upgraded and laden with extras for which a premium price was charged, and cash-strapped BL was desperate for some of the action. The reason for raising this is that VPs weren't actually badged as Austins (or Allegros for that matter), but sold as a separate marque albeit through the same BL dealderships,so the pic shouldn't appear on the Austin history page cos it isn't.

The fact that it is so famous is of extremely important encyclopedic value, since most readers will have no knowledge of the fact that the Ajax Academy is any more important than the Chelsea Academy (for example). The Chelsea Academy has in fact been modeled on the Ajax academy, and has been implemented by Piet de Visser and Henk ten Cate (well until Grant was fired). The Barcelona academy was totally based on the Ajax Academy and was implemented when Cruyff was manager there. These are historical facts and it's not like I'm some kind of marketing executive from Dubai trying to say that Manchester City has the best academy ever. Incidentally, the Ajax Academy in it's current form was originally set up by Rinus Michels, who is credited with the invention of a major football tactic known as """"Total Football"""" (as played by Ajax, Barcelona, and Arsenal today) and was named """"coach of the century"""" by FIFA in 1999. It is not a peacock term if it has been widely recognised and acknowledged and can be referenced by multiple sources like the BBC and Fifa. 77.250.200.70  """,0

"Erik, for crying out loud. You legally can have sex with children, but not with underage children. Underage children are children beneath the legal age of consent (different states have 14, 15, 16, 17 or 18 as the underage limit. Children in most countries means someone under the age of 18. In Ireland for example, a 'child' aged 17 is over the age of consent. In Britain it is 16. Do you know the first thing about the topic? 

The name is standard english asage. Scandal is a POV term. Allegation allows the discussion of cases that have not yet come to court, which cannot for technical reasons be prosecuted and cases that were thrown up as invalid. Roman Catholic Church sex abuses allegations in standard english means allegations about the Roman Catholic Church.

Miss informs people, and twists facts, he uses this tactics on the roman accounts, leaving out who won in popmeii and following it in with a non credible source William bridges is not a historian, but he uses it to capitalize on the archaeology book, in fact that book roots to the fact the lion defeated the tiger, as roman/italian sites says the tiger is being attacked by a lion:
[url]http://www.romanoimpero.com/2010/01/pompei.html[/url]

He routes it to the usual that it was a leopard, but the leopard mosaic is in the house of doves, the lion standing over a prostrated tiger is in the house of faun. Several members point out his major flaws such as Bbbeto, as he states its not that the sources arnt reliable he just doesnt want anything that favors the lion and will show the lion as the usual winner, its not that they arent peer jorunals, its that the support the lion, he has erased over 20 things not seeable now on the talk page and edit page, it doesnt matter if its from a trainer, if they support the lion he will call it unreliable and the rules dont apply...what rules? Its only his rules, there hasnt been a consensus done by 10 people at once going on over 6 years? Is this what wiki is for, for who ever is the more persistent and the better liar to be able to control wiki? Its just his ) and he should be banned from editing that topic, since he is already a part of over 20 forums specifically on topic where he has been caught lying, for instance he just said he has graduated from 10 university's...
[url]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:BigCat82[/url]

Really he graduated from 10 of the top university around the world? Show us just one of them, name the university, show us who you studied under, show us a copy of your diploma, he is a pathological liar, look under the bear contributions countless of people call him specifically a tiger fan, look at the talk page there, the lion vs tiger contribution, only he is ever erasing things of favoring the lion, Wikipedia mods should be ashamed for having a person use its search engine for a person pumping out his own propaganda and bias POV for this amount of time unchecked. He now says that no experts favor a lion, really? Define expert, if we look at what wiki has as expert:
[url]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert[/url]

We can see that an expert is someone who has pro-longed experience or observation, the topic is about them fighting, so they have to have excerpts and citations of them seeing a fight...no excerpts of them exist for the tiger so far, yet he disputes people who does, and is considered experts.

I then studied physics at the University of Canterbury, under Prof. Roy Kerr, the rotating black hole theorist. I've kept in touch with a few of those guys over the years, and they've introduced me to certain other """"big names"""" in physics. I bailed out of the academy before gaining a doctorate, preferring a broad interdisciplinary education, and disgusted by the stress, pressure, politics, and the close-minded arrogance of certain professional academics. I had a fun life instead, and followed my curiosity about gravitation, astrophysics and cosmology in a totally relaxed way. Over the past decade or so, I've been privy to hearing about some very exciting developments in theoretical physics, particularly with regards to the unification problem. I can't say too much, because *cough* Nobel *cough*. If, just saying, somebody (hypothetically) had actually nailed the spin-2 boson, but hadn't yet published anything until it's mathematically robust, peer-reviewed, etc, then it's (hypothetically) highly likely that the solution would involve a mathematical toolkit comprising complex dimensional analysis, multi-dimensional special & general relativity, loop quantum gravity, E8 Theory, etc. Just wildly speculating here, but it's the 100th anniversary of Einstein's publication of GR — could be a very big year for physics.

Narayana Guru and Atheism

I disagree with the text in this section. Associating Narayana Guru with atheism clearly shows the lack of knowledge of the originating author on the Guru's philosophical and metaphysical works and perspective and reasoning of the Universe. Proclaimed atheists being associated with an individual in social reform initiatives does not by itself make the individual an atheist.

Also there is a clear distinction between rationalists and atheists.

This section needs to be edited.

Narayana Guru and Sahodran Ayyappan

Narayana Guru had disagreed with Sahodaran Ayyappan when the latter tried to corrupt Guru's teachings with Atheism.In fact Ayyappan requested Guru's permission to modify the slogan  'Oru Jati , Oru Matham, Oru Daivam Manushyanu' as 'Jati Venda, Matham Venda, Daivam Venda'. However, Guru ridiculed him by asking """" If Ayyappan wants to collect Rs.1 from each person to set up a library,  you will ask ' Give One Rupee,Give One Rupee,Give One Rupee'. Does that mean ' No Rupee,No Rupee,No Rupee """" ?

This 'Sahodaran' kept quiet at that time.However, he renewed his Atheist activities after the samadhi of Guru, thereby corrupting Guru's ideology. Vested interests fully exploited this confusion to corrupt Guru's teachings by projecting this 'Sahodaran' even above Guru.

Clarification on Atheism

No where in the article did I say that Naryanaguru was an atheist. What I wrote was “his attitude towards the existence of a personal god is considered quite ambivalent” and that many of his followers had considered him an atheist.  Can somebody point out which sentence of the article gives such an impression that he was an atheist?  It goes to the credit of Sri Narayanaguru that in spite of being a theist, he openly accepted even atheists as his core desciples. The importance of this can be guaged only if one consideres the period in which he lived.

One also has to be clear about the kind of thiesm Narayana Guru adovocated. It definitely was not the one associated with the brahaminical/casteist Hiduism.

I find it bit difficult to comprehend why this section on atheism and atheist followers of Narayanaguru should be edited out.  A discussion/debate on the philosophy of Narayanaguru is thoroughly understandable but I find it puzzling that the followers of Narayanaguru are getting overly agitated on hearing the word atheism. Pity indeed! 

And I agree with Aaroamal that there is a distintion between rationalist and atheist. That is precisely why I assert in my user page of wikipedia that I am both an atheist and rationalist.

 Clarification on Atheism 

Manoj, True, you did not explicitly write that Narayana Guru was an atheist. However, you implicitly structured a (misinformed and incomplete) statement as follows:

 “When Sahodaran Ayyappan modified Narayana Guru's famous catchphrase, Oru Jati, Oru Matham, Oru Daivam Manushyanu (One Caste, One Religion, One God for Humanbeing) and re-written it as Jati Venda, Matham Venda, Daivam Venda Manushyanu…the latter did not protest”. 

Obviously by stating that “…the latter did not protest”, here you are clearly implying that Narayana Guru accepted Sahodaran Ayyappan’s atheistic view as amendment to the famous catchphrase. I am sorry to say that this is absolutely false!

Everybody appreciates that Narayana Guru was tolerant of atheists because he respected an individual’s fundamental right and freedom to belief, or disbelief, in the exitence of God. That tolerant attitude however should not be misinterpreted to imply otherwise.

As Krishnan has already pointed out, Narayana Guru’s reaction to Sahodaran Ayyappan’s revised version of the slogan was a clear protest, so it is not true to say …”the latter did not protest”.

Please could you explain what you mean by saying, “his attitude towards the existence of a personal god is considered quite ambivalent”; are you referring to any of Narayana Guru’s writings, if so which one? Which serious scholar of Narayana Guru has so commented? Also, in what context is that statement being included under the heading “Narayana Guru and Atheism”.

How America Entered The War
Flynn Writes About The Diplomatic Secret Service  By F. W. Elven, Correspondent Of The München Latest
News  Cincinnati, Mid June
William J. Flynn has published a part of his War Memoirs in the weekly Liberty, which is much read here.
During the war, Flynn was the Head Of The United States Secret Service. The Service encompasses the whole
country, and is brilliantly organised. In peacetime it primarily provides for the personal security of the President.
Its attention is enjoyed by whatever else in the national capital is in need of protection, or thinks it needs so. It
keeps under surveillance all doubtful elements somehow suspected of connections with political tendencies
hostile to the government and its spokesmen. During the war its principal task was to keep an eye on those who
more or less loudly had made themselves noticeable in opposition to the war, or who merely were suspected of
not being in agreement with the Wilsonian war policy. Germans also enjoyed its special care, and at that time
many fell into the traps which had been laid everywhere by the Federal Secret Service.
From Flynn's memoirs, however, we learn that the Secret Service had been assigned an important mission even
before our entry into the war. In the year 1915, a full two years before the declaration of war, the most efficient
telephone expert was summoned to Washington and assigned the task of arranging the leading telephone wires
to the German and Austrian embassies in such a way that Secret Service officials could tap every conversation
from any source that was held between the ambassadors and their personnel, as well as every conversation
emanating from the embassy offices. A room was set up with which all the wires were linked in such an
ingenious way that not even a single conversation could be missed. Service men sat in this room day and night,
dictating the overheard conversations to the stenographers seated beside them. Every night the head of the Secret
Service Bureau, that is, the author of the article in Liberty, received a stenographic report of all the conversations
held in the preceding twenty four hours, so that on the very same evening he was able to communicate
everything important to the State Department and to President Wilson.
Let us bear in mind the time this installation was created, at the beginning of the year 1915, that is, at the time
when the United States still lived in peace with Germany and Austria-Hungary, and Wilson never tired of giving
assurances that he harboured no hostile intentions against Germany. It was also the time when the German
Ambassador in Washington, Count Bernstorff, neglected no opportunity to show due appreciation of Wilson's
friendly disposition and feelings for Germany and the German Folk. It was also the time when Wilson gave his
confidant Baruch instructions to begin the gradual mobilisation of industry for war; also the time in which it
became increasingly obvious, as the American historian Harry Elmer Barnes also sets forth in his book On The
Origins Of The Great War, that Wilson was firmly decided to enter the war, and postponed the execution of his
bellicose plans only because public opinion first had to be won over for these plans.
Flynn's memoirs must finally remove the ground from the foolish chatter that Wilson was pushed into the war
against his will by German submarine warfare. The tapping of the telephone wires leading to the German
embassy took place with his knowledge. We also learn this from Flynn's memoirs. The author adds that the
material thus gathered against Germany contributed considerably to the eventual break. This can prove only that
this put means in Wilson's hands to win public opinion for the war long planned by him. And in fact this
material was wholly and ideally suited for it. The Memoirs confirm to the fullest extent what unfortunately must
still be said, that Germany at that time was represented in Washington in a downright incredibly incompetent
and incredibly unworthy way. If we hear that in one passage Flynn writes that the stenographic reports prepared
for him daily contained enough material to keep a divorce lawyer busy for months on end, then we get a general
idea of what went on.
The Secret Service maintained women agents in Washington and New York whose job it was to sound out the
members of the German Embassy, Bernstorff included, whenever anything important happened. One of these
woman agents kept a better class apartment in Washington in which the gentlemen met their ladies, and where
occasionally even Secretary Of State Lansing dropped in to hear what was new. On New Year's Day, 1916,

 links 

Dharmabum420 and others seem to enjoy removing links from the article. I am not a webmaster or even know one. I found the site outside the wall on my space, and since then have found it to be quicker on posting news and tour info then any of the other sites. I think it deserves a link here with the others. I must admit, I messed up the link by missing a few rules to begin, but since then have fixed that. Dharmabum420 said it seemed self promotion, well I simply just copied the title of the page, it is not self promotion. Since then I have written what features the site holds, but it continues to be removed. Google stats do not legitimate how good a site is for info, and this is NOT a rule by Wikipedia, so stop treating it as one. Thank you, please keep the link 
I would suggest the link be removed until a consensus can be reached here.
I'll assume that it's not self-promotion despite the earlier """"greatest site ever!"""" type description, but regardless, I would personally argue against the inclusion of the site, for a variety of reasons:
Wikipedia is not a link repository, and guidlines suggest only one fan site for such an article, and we already have far more than that.
No Google hit within the first 100 links in a """"pink floyd"""" search and no Alexa rating; while not a set policy on Wikipedia, such rankings are often used to determine a site's notability when trying to decide whether to include the site in an article already well-stocked with other, high-rated sites.
The only content on the site that is not easily available on far more popular sites is a selection of photos of people's tattoos. While mildly interesting, it's hard to argue that it increases the value of the Pink Floyd article itself, as few people who read the article will be searching it out for information on Pink Floyd tattoos.
Much content on the site is commerical, marketing T-shirts and the like. This is clear in the discography, which holds no information other than a simple list of the albums (available on Wikipedia itself anyway) with links to purchase them to an Amazon seller account.
The site in question is very low-quality compared to the rest of the resource links; confusing, messy and difficult to navigate, intrusive music with no way of turning it off, and it has major compatibility problems with Firefox 1.5 and Safari (perhaps others, that's what I've got to try).
That's my 2¢ on this particular site. - a 

I'll double 's 2¢ and even add in another penny to make it an even nickel. It's a very sub-par site and doesn't contribute anything to this article.  

I will disagree with both of you. while you claim only one fan site is appropriate, it clearly states """"Note: fanlistings are generally not informative and should not ordinarily be included.)"""" this fansite is very imformative and has more details on wanted details. For example, this site has details about a On an island live dvd with a direct link to saying David will record the rah shows for a dvd. Visit the other sites, none of them have this info and this is just one instance. You are wrong about it being the normal material. Also after paying attention to this site for sometime, it has continued to be the first in announcing tour dates for Rogers tour, and apparently has already secured a interview with one of Rogers bandmates. While you may think that the videos on the site are annoying, many fans love this. I am one of them, I cant think of another site where I can view much of the videos on this site. You say its difficult to navigate and I laugh at that, there is a simple naviagtion bar at the left hand side of each page, just like fleeting glimpses bar. Also every site has a discography, but very few have a videography, this alon makes this site better then most. So it has some comercial availability...so what? It still is a great source of info. Your google pink floyd rankings are a joke. 80 out of the first 100 are not updated and far subpar then this site. I wonder how many people search for pink floyd tattos, probably far more then you think, because I for one know of no other site that has this, and I have picked a tat from the site to get myself. This site deserves a link and I disagree with both of you

 Also now that I think about it, show me another site that streams Davids mermaid gig, or has each of his promo videos for tracks of the new album? Not even DG.com has those avaialable anymore.

No one is disputing that a debate exists over the proper naming convention, the question is over the degree to which that debate should be reflected in the name of the article. I'm all for delineating the various points of view on why one name is used by one group of people, and the article does a good job of that. But as you point out the most widely used name is FGM, and if a 4.5 or 3 to 1 ratio is not a significant  majority than I don't know what it is. Secondly, the pov issue is very much with the people here and not with the literature. Lets be clear about the rationale of the UN bodies which have opted to use the term FGC. According to their own websites (and this page), they use the term FGC in communities where the term FGM may be seen as counterproductive to the goal of reducing the occurrence of FGM. They do not use it in their published literature and their websites make it clear that it is an application of the term for case-specific scenarios and not as an overall attempt to cease the use of the term FGM.   19:48",0

Roy, good questions. Yes it's actual thrust data from the Columbia mission, STS-107. However you can't directly measure thrust. Rather it's calculated from other parameters such as chamber pressure. Also the thrust curve is generally corrected to constant sea level or constant vacuum thrust. In actuality the physical thrust would be constantly changing, even if engine thrust was constant (which it's not for the SRBs). I include below some more info I was preparing to post:

Because of the frequent confusion on this point, I uploaded a thrust/time graph for the SRBs. I also revised the thrust numbers in the article to reflect this. SRB sea level liftoff thrust is 2.8 million pounds each. Each SSME produces 393,000 pounds sea level thrust at 104% power level. Thus the shuttle total liftoff thrust is: (393,000 * 3) + (2,800,000 * 2) = 6.779 million pounds force, or 3.075 million kgf, or 30.16 MN. Using these numbers the SRBs provide 82.6% of liftoff thrust. 

This is confusing because many sources just blindly copy the 3.3 million pound thrust number, some even erroneously adding """"sea level"""" or """"liftoff"""" thrust. There are six possible thrust numbers for the SRB:

 Sea level liftoff thrust
 Sea level peak thrust
 Sea level average thrust
 Vacuum liftoff thrust
 Vacuum peak thrust
 Vacuum average thrust

The problem is most references don't state which they are using. This is why references state SRB thrust from 2.65 million lbs (probably sea level average thrust) to 3.4 million lbs (probably vacuum peak thrust).

When comparing SRB thrust to, say, Saturn V F-1 engine thrust, you must consider the different characteristics of each engine type. The F-1 is not throttlable, so excluding altitude variations always produces the same thrust. At sea level this is 1.5298 million lbs per engine or 7.649 million lbs thrust total. By comparision the SRB thrust changes over the burn time (see chart). Space shuttle total sea level liftoff thrust is 6.779 million pounds force, or about 88.6% of the Saturn V.

In theory you could compare the SRB thrust at T+20 sec which is somewhat higher, but that wouldn't be liftoff thrust.  """,0

""". If you want to talk about linguistic issues in the Spanish State, or about terrorist bands linked to nationalism, do so at their right articles. The way you try to shove those topics in an article about """"Nationalities in Spain"""""""" looks like you´re trying to inject your personal, unfavourable to those independentist movements POV in this article. Please stop doing that.  

My dear 81.202.96.146, please stop asking me to stop from doing this or that, for it is not your duty to tell me so. Give your opinion and defend it as you may, as I am doing, and put the full stop after it. Now, it seems that we cannot insert anything here that raises the slightest doubt against the legitimacy of """"those independentist movements"""". Sorry, I won't bother creating an article entitled """"Terrorist groups linked to X nationalism""""; but I do believe that if there's an article that deals with """"X nationalism"""" or """"Nationalities in Y"""", which includes """"X nationalism"""", it is only right to talk about those terrorist groups. To your accusation:

 I already assumed above that I was biased, as anyone else (my quote: """"Of course, this I'm saying is only part of the story; but it corresponds with the same reality and nothing about it is being said in this biased article."""").
 I haven't edited the article yet, because I think the subject is worthy of a discussion, no matter how ridiculous the article itself seems to me.
 Due to 1's """" as anyone else"""", your accusation can bounce back at you with a very slight variation: you are trying to prevent obnoxious information about nationalism from entering the article, thus unveiling your point of view... So, what's wrong about it?
 The problem with your POV is that you already stated something false about the article to defend your position and I refuted it. Your only answer now is to say that my views should belong to another article.

I don't know what your reasons are for defending the accuracy of this article; clearly not the article itself. My own are simply that, if we are to talk about such a delicate subject as """"nationalities in Spain"""" we'd better document ourselves and tell everything that ought to be told.

 

 Why can´t I ask you to stop doing something I find incorrect? You are in fact, doing the same, by asking me not to do it. See the irony? I wasn´t issuing orders, just asking kindly for you to stop doing that. If you don´t want to, it´s ok.
By order:
1- Everyone is biased, that´s ok. But Wikipedia is not a soapbox. If you want to voice your personal concerns about """"spanish speakers opressed in Catalonia"""", that´s fine with me, but please don´t do it in an eclyclopedical article right? When we contribute to a wikipedia article, it´s not enough to go """"OK I´m biased because I think this and that, so let the battle begin"""". No, we try to put aside our differences and be as neutral as possible. I´m not trying to point out my ideas in an article, as if I were hoping to clash with you and eventually """"reach a middle ground"""" in the article´s content. No. I´m trying to be objective in this article, and you´re not, because you´re admiting to be biased AND allowing your bias to affect your output in this article.
2- That´s very respectful of you, and I think it´s the right thing to do.
3- No it doesn´t. I am not trying to push an agenda here. I am just pointing the OBVIOUS LOGICAL fact that articles should talk about the topic they´re about. If I, for example tried to hide the racialist doctrines Sabino Arana had, in an article about Sabino Arana, you could rightfully accuse me of """"preventing obnoxious information"""" from getting into the article. But asking for an article named Nationalities in Spain to talk about those nationalities and not about terrorist gangs that claim to defend some of the ideologies that support independentist claims based on the actual nationalities we´re talking about in this article, is just asking for something entirely reasonable. See the far away link between your proposed """"terrorist issue"""" stuff and the actual content of the article? As I said, create an article about Terrorist gangs linked to nationalist claims in Spain, and everything will be fine. By your same reasoning, anyone could end up talking about the IRA in an article about Catholicism.
4- What did I state that was false? I made only one comment before this one, just to ask you to stop trying to shove terrorist stuff in an article that is not about terrorism. Seems perfectly reasonable to me. Bye

I also created Dance-Rock redirect.   

AllMusic source
This article is one of a number of music genre articles that were created solely using AllMusic as a source, and for which few other sources seemed to be available. I'd rather have just deleted it, but decided instead to trim and rephrase it so that it was perfectly clear that elevating the term """"post-disco"""" to genre status was apparently an attempt to fill a gap in AllMusic's taxonomy of genres, and that it was the creation of a now-uncredited individual author who was paid to write it. Also I wanted to show the author never really defined it as a musical style; it wasn't ever established how it was related to disco on one end and house music on the other.

Recently the article has been expanded to cite other mentions of """"post-disco"""". I'm fine with that, but I'm not convinced every use of the term was really intended to be interpreted as a genre name. I'm just afraid this article is doing the exact same thing the AllMusic blurb did: trying too hard to give traction to a name for something that really didn't have a name, or that perhaps was only called """"boogie"""". I feel like I'd rather see a section of the Boogie article devoted to the dance music genre than to continue down the road of searching for vague references to dance music in the post-disco era as evidence of an accepted genre name. —  
My opinion is that post-disco is also genre (""""boogie""""), but also a movement, but that's WP:POV. I don't know.. I mean I don't understand what's really """"post-disco"""" (after disco era / boogie genre ?) means at all. If it is """"era"""" so all tracks to present is """"post-disco"""", but if it is a genre... (unsourced; only AMG and some kind of sites like """" danceclassics.net"""" etc).   

 OR & source misrepresentation in lead: analysis 

None of the cited sources other than Allmusic suggest that """"post-disco"""" is a genre. Many of the citations are also WP:SPS.

The term post-disco (or simply boogie) has multiple meanings. Citation does not support the assertion that """"post-disco"""" has multiple meanings or that it is a term interchangeable with Boogie

Sometime after 1990,AMG was founded in 1991 —  an Allmusic editorial contributor used """"post-disco"""" in an attempt to isolate a dance music genre in the era between the indistinct """"end"""" of disco music and the equally indistinct emergence of house music. Proposition unsupported by a third party verifiable source, this is editorial analysis therefore WP:OR

Gains have been fairly uniform across the entire range of black cognitive ability.[28] J. Philippe Rushton and Arthur R. Jensen have disputed Dickens's and Flynn's findings, calculating a mean gain for Blacks of zero to 3.44 IQ points, and questioned the exclusion of four independent tests that showed low or negative IQ gains.[33] However, in the very same 2006 study that was criticized by Rushton and Jensen, Flynn and Dickens give explicit reasons for why four tests were excluded. Rushton and Jensen include in test such as the AFQT which is not strictly an IQ tests and their inclusion of Herrnstein and Murray's AFQT data was criticized by Flynn and Dickens.

The opening paragraph is a very accessible introduction to the form of the game. However the definition of a run would be useful here, otherwise it stands as an undefined term until sometime later in the article.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 80.169.130.38

"Regarding Reversion on John Duncan (theologian)

Hi. Yes, I suppose that you are right to revert my edit on John Duncan (theologian). When I read the article initially I believe that I primarily 'saw' that he was already going to university to pursue theological study without taking a more granular look at what the text actually says and integrating in my comprehension what that meant. He is an unusual fellow in that he was apparently an atheist (according to his own conception) who was already studying to become a doctrinal minister which runs counterintuitive to my expectation of those who study theology. Theological students may have some misgivings about their beliefs and doctrine but are not ordinarily 'atheist', or even deist, in their self-description. Thanks for the reversion. Regards, Steve.",0

The topic of mutual intelligibility in Slavic languages is a bit difficult. For example, Bulgarian is routinely regarded as a language most distant from the Slavic type and very difficult to understand for most Slavs. In Czech, there even exists a saying """"speaking like a Bulgarian"""" for unintelligible speech. Yet the difficulties in understanding lie mainly in grammar (the non-existence of word-endings, the use of articles). You can listen to a Bulgarian, not to understand a word and doubt, if you are actually listening to an Indo-European language - and then you see a Bulgarian text and you are surprised that you can read it quite with ease. So the difference in understanding spoken language and written language can be huge. 
As for the difference between Czech/Slovak and Polish, I must agree with the Polish contributor above that a fluent conversation is not possible. Yet you can certainly understand a lot and conduct some conversation, if you try to be patient. So """"a limited intelligibility"""" would be a more correct term. As for written Polish, Czechs and Slovaks shouldn't have any difficulties with a general understanding Polish text, although quite a few words (especially of technical sort) may seem obscure and untintelligible. However, the closest Slavic language to Czech (after Slovak) is Lusitan Sorbian, especially Upper Sorbian. I don't have any personal experience with this language, but from the written texts I saw I think that its resemblance to Czech can be compared to East Slovakian dialects (which means that you can understand some passages easily, but subsequently you can be lost due to accumulation of weirdly sounding words.)

i don't think cows can be tipped either, but this is hardly an article that meets wikipedia policy/guidelines/standards for clarity, neutrality, or good writing. the second paragraph, for example, is badly written, pretend-intellectual humoro-babble for the sole purpose of setting up the inclusion of the cutesy, unnecessary phrase """"precarious ruminants"""". the refrigerator example is strained, nowhere mentioning center of gravity. rather, it encourages a lower center of gravity than an honest attempt to simulate a cow would have, while making sure to reduce the lever. that's just the start. i would hack/slash my way through the thing, but i can tell from the history that it's the pet of some watching worshipers.

Furthermore, Ruslik0 is incorrect that I made a false accusation regarding the objective fact that Jeffro77 is engaging in vandalism: Jeffro77 replaced this entrywhich is very similar to the version that existed there since October 31, 2008, with some improvementswith this entry, giving the excuse in his edit summary of """"WP:FRINGE,"""" which doesn't even make sense as an explanation for his edits: i.e., deletion of a number of citations; deletion of the information on theologian Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg's defense of the theology of the Omega Point Theory; etc. As well, there's no need for the large displayed quote, as the previous entry already stated that Prof. David Deutsch doesn't agree that the Omega Point is God; furthermore, Jeffro77's edit deletes the mention of the fact that Prof. Deutsch endorses the physics of the Omega Point Theory.

In addtion, Jeffro77's edit isn't even literate, as he give the following mangled citation to Prof. Deutsch: """"Chapter 14: """"The Ends of the Universe,"""" with additional comments by Frank J. Tipler; also available here"""". Whereas the version before was properly cited: """"David Deutsch, The Fabric of Reality: The Science of Parallel Universes—and Its Implications (London: Allen Lane The Penguin Press, 1997), ISBN 0713990619. Extracts from Chapter 14: """"The Ends of the Universe,"""" with additional comments by Frank J. Tipler; also available here and here.""""

As stated above, Jeffro77's excuse in his edit summary doesn't even make sense, as it doesn't explain why he would delete mention of Prof. Deutsch's endorsement of the physics of the Omega Point Theory, particularly since Jeffro77 himself called Deutsch an """"eminent physicist"""" in his own edit (i.e., that statement wasn't there before): of which argues against the notion that Jeffro77 considers the physics of the Omega Point Theory as fringe. Further, Jeffro77 deleted mention of the fact that Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg, who is one of the leading theologians in the world, has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory and Tipler's position that the Omega Point is consistent with the Judeo-Christian God.

Additionally, while Jeffro77's """"fringe"""" claim's aren't even relevant to his edit, they have already been refuted numerous times. Indeed, Jeffro77 himself refutes this claim in this very edit of his: to state again, therein Jeffro77 himself called Prof. Deutsch an """"eminent physicist"""" in his own words. So obviously Jeffro77 himself must consider Deutsch's endorsement of the physics of the Omega Point Theory to be noteworthy, and yet he deleted this endoresement in an area where Jeffro77 himself agrees that Deutsch is eminently qualified and replaced it with a large displayed quotation regarding a matter that Deutsch has no qualification or erudition in, even though the previous version already clearly mentioned that Deutsch disagrees that Omega Point is God. Moreover, in this edit Jeffro77 deletes all mention of the fact that an actual trained theologian, Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg, who is one of the world's leading theologians, has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory.

As well, Prof. Tipler himself has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory and his identification of the Omega Point as being God in a peer-reviewed academic journal: see Frank J. Tipler, """"The Omega Point as Eschaton: Answers to Pannenberg's Questions for Scientists,"""" Zygon: Journal of Religion & Science, Vol. 24, Issue 2 (June 1989), pp. 217-253. Regarding the physics, Prof. Tipler has published his Omega Point Theory in many peer-reviewed science journals, including a number of the leading physics journals such as Reports on Progress in Physics (one of the world's leading physics journals) and Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (one of the world's leading astrophysics journals). The Wikipedia article on the Omega Point Theory lists seven different mainstream peer-reviewed scientific journals in which Tipler's Omega Point Theory has been published (and that's not including the Zygon journal). That is quite a significant amount.

"Still, it's clear that Wulfila chose a lot of his spelling conventions based on those of Greek. Using 𐌴𐌹 to write a long [iː] was certainly one of those conventions, and another clear example is using 𐌲 to represent [ŋ]. He couldn't have based his choice of 𐌰𐌿 on Greek (because there it was becoming [af] rather than a long vowel), but for 𐌰𐌹 he probably was inspired by Greek. So what sound was αι in the Greek of the time? Was it higher than ε or lower? The page Koine Greek phonology shows that both were in fact homophones and had been already for hundreds of years before. So if he took those two writing conventions from Greek, he did not take their pronunciations as they are different in Gothic. That means that we have to derive the pronunciations of those two vowels from loanwords. What letters does Wulfila use to substitute for η in Greek loanwords? And what about Latin, which he no doubt knew as well? The Latin of the time had ĕ [ɛ] and ē [e], length distinctions were probably disappearing (see Vulgar Latin). So what does Wulfila use for these two Latin sounds?",0

For the sake of anyone reading this in the future, expected value is actually fairly easy to determine.  A (barely) simplified version of the formula for this discussion is: Number of Decisions * Average Bet * House Edge = Expected Value.  On a single number, single spin bet of $1 as the table suggests the EV according to that formula is 1 (decision) * 1 (bet) * 0.053 (edge, rounded) = $0.053.  For 10,000 spins at $1 the EV is $530 meaning the casino wins $530 as stated.  

To determine the player's edge for a straight up bet take the chances of winning (1/38) multiplied by the payout (35) plus the chances of losing (37/38) multiplied by the loss (-1).  (1/38 * 35) + (37/38 * -1) = -0.05263 or a loss of $0.05263 per dollar bet.  If you do the math this is the same edge for any double-zero wheel bet except for the top line.  As a random side note, to quickly determine the payout for any combination of numbers: 36/(numbers bet) - 1 = payout.  For example a street is three numbers so 36/3 - 1 = 11 therefore a street pays 11/1.    08:24, 17 February 2012",0

 Understanding """"Wikified"""" language 

Hi, and thanks for taking the time to """"Wikify"""" the language I added to """"Ballast Point"""".
If you don't mind, I would like to ask a question so I can better understand this; I am new to this, still learning.
The background is that in the 1800s, the European settlement of the Sydney area was in its early days.  Place names were informal, and often duplicated.  There were at least two, probably three places on Sydney Harbour known as """"Ballast Point"""" then.  This is what I attempted to clarify with my comment that it was another site also known by that name.  The revised wording gives me the impression that there was only one place of that name in the 1800s, and it changed.  So can you please indicate why the new wording is preferred, so I can adopt the best approach in future?   """,0
"Improvements
I have completed the B class checklist and feel that this article could be improved by addressing the following issues:

 Referencing: in line citations could be added to assist in the verification process. This is essential for a successful B class rating. A rule of thumb is at least one per paragraph, more if more than one source was used, or if there are multiple assertions that might be challenged if not backed up by an in line citation;
 Grammar: the article needs a few tweaks for grammar. Use of '&' in a sentence is not usually preferred under the WP:MOS, additionally some of the wording might be tightened, e.g. '855th Guard squadron...would occupy'. This is a bit cumbersome and perhaps could be improved by saying '855th Guard squadron...occupied'. This would also serve to fix any tense issues that might exist.

Just a few ideas. Once you have done these, you might like to seek re-assessment. This can be done at WP:MHA, or if you would like further input on possible improvements, go to WP:MHPR. Hope this helps.",0

"Thanks for your comments. I can understand how debates with people who have a fundamentalist disposition can be very frustrating and in some ways provoke a similar response. I assure I have no axe to grind on this subject. There may be ideas put forward through certain forms of creationism that I simply do not believe because it contradicts the available scientific evidence and I may find certain claims put forward as science exaggerated. It would not stop me reporting those beliefs if they represented a significant number of people or if they had a significant impact in a given society even though they were only held by a minority, albeit influential, section of the community. For example if a country has only small minority of people who believe in a literal six days account of creation yet they have an disproportionate influence on that society, for example in education, politics or the media, then I would cite the best available work(s) I know that support their idea but I would also put in the best arguments against them in a concise summary of the issue with links wherever possible to other articles that examine particular issues in more depth. I approach these kind of articles by imagining that I am an open minded reader who knows little about the subject but would like to see what the main issues are without anybody censoring or filtering out material they personally do not believe in. This imaginary reader likes to form his own opinions based on the best available information with a preference for top down structure in the article, i.e. general outlines of the issue followed by a more detailed exposition.

"Thanks for your suggestions, Hpvpp. I can tell that you really care about this issue. But honestly I think it's a terrible suggestion. Structuring discussion of linguistic relativity around the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis on one hand and fictional languages on the other (with or without splitting) would be like structuring discussion of Special relativity around electrodyanmics on one hand and fictional space ships on the other. Yes, notions of linguistic relativity have been important in some sectors of speculative fiction, just as notions of faster-that-light travel have been in others. That does not mean that fiction plays a comparably important role in the philosophy of language nor in physics. As Maunus says, this article is, and ought to be, about the linguistic and philosophical treatment of various notions of linguistic relativity, not about their uptake in fiction, among creators of constructed languages, or in other creative applications.

A history of scholarship on language and thought may or may not be useful.

We trust editors to create articles, complex templates, categories and upload material, but to create a stub type, they have to ask permission. Do you not find it a bit strange that you need to ask permission (Wikipedia:Stub types for deletion/Log/2008/April/6) to delete a category, update nine templates and create the correct category?

I wonder if we could embellish the narrative on this election. There were at least three very important developments in this race.

1. It was the first presidential election in which the national ticket was nominated in conventions. The Anti-Masonic, National Republican, and Democratic Parties held national conventions. 

2. One of the major issues was nullification (the idea that states could 'nullify' or veto congressional legislation). Calhoun refused to run with Jackson for this reason, and South Carolina entered a brief anti-Democratic phase. Calhoun resigned as VP, the first person to do that, and became an anti-administration U.S. Senator. 

3. Another major issue was the National Bank. Clay forced a vote on extending the charter of the Bank in the summer of 1832. Jackson vetoed it. Clay felt that the Bank would be critical to economic development. Jackson did not have a specific policy - Van Buren later created the independent treasury system which laid the groundwork for the banking system which is still in place.",0

"""YOUR SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS AND ADDICTION==

This is the most """"contructive"""" thing that can ever be contributed as it relates to you and your involvement here: Please stop and think about the depth of your sickness, sitting there, with your face glued to your computer screen, uncompensated day after day, week after week, for YEARS, tinkering with the biographies of people you don't even know, who actually are out living real lives while you are imprisoned by your addiction.  You have literally wasted years of your life with this lonely, self-destructive addiction and illness, which has been at the expense of living your own life.  The depth of your mental illness must make it difficult for you to see the extraordinary insanity of your actions and how your addiction has stripped you of the life that was given you.  

I know a few others have evaluated what you do here and laugh at you and your sickness.  It's something of an inside joke, and I guess few share it with you because they consider you hopeless.  That's not right either, and I'd ask them to please stop that and try to help you.  Don't laugh at this person behind their back and then just communicate with them on routine matters.  That lacks all caring for a person who has an obvious and very serious illness. Something is very wrong with him/her, and while it may not be for us to diagnose the exact problem, we should pause to help with advice.  Please share with him/her what we all know.  It's only humane to do so. 

I will do so now too:

Jerzy (or whatever your name isconsciously concealed, I'm sure, to keep your illness as private as possible), please consider some uncomfortable facts:  Years of your life have now been totally consumed and absolutely wasted by your deep, deep sickness and obvious addiction.  Please don't make excuses for yourself.  You cannot go on like this any longer.  You need to stop, and you need to stop today.  Reject this advice, and I worry that your sickness will probably only deepen and your addiction will waste whatever is left of your life.  Please stop.  It's over.  Enough.  Move on.  I do wish you the best and hope you will take this friendly advice seriously.  It will be the first and last time I share it, and I hope you know that I share it only with your best interests in mind.  It's sad what has happened to you, but I wish you good luck and hope this advice is helpful.  But please take itand do so today.  You cannot go on like this.

Post replies to the main talk page, copying or summarizing the section you are replying to if necessary.

First section of history

Is everyone ok with this part of the history?  If so we can go ahead and move it into the article and get started on the second part.

In 1974, Tina Barber, of Shiloh Shepherd Kennel in New York State, began  developing a unique line of German Shepherds. Her goal was to preserve the type of  dog she remembered from her childhood in Germany; dogs who are good family  companions, exceptionally intelligent, mentally sound, big and beautiful - similar to  Chuck Eisenmann's dogs from The Littlest Hobo.  After years of selective breeding  and genetic research, she seperated her dogs from the AKC in 1990.

In 1991, The Shiloh Shepherd Dog Club of America (SSDCA, Inc.) was incorporated.   Shilohs were originally registered dually through the FIC and AKC, but after  difficulty with standards verification, the SSDCA decided to open the first  Shiloh-only registry, The International Shiloh Shepherd Registry (ISSR). Due to some  documentation problems with the original ISSR registrar, a special program was  designed by The Complete Computer Place (TCCP) to process registry data for the ISSR. Since then more than 4,000 dogs have been registered with the ISSR. They also  maintain a database with over 45,000 ancestors in order to properly calculate various  factors within the limited genepool.

Thanks .:..:. babelfish 

Since there haven't been any objections, I'll go ahead and move this to the article so we can focus on working the second section.  I also hope to be able to expand and work on some of the other sections today to get closer to the Manual of Style guidelines and start setting this article up for featured article status. .:..:. babelfish 

This may be too late, but I think the fact that the ISSR was started in 1991 should be made clear and also that the TCCP started to maintain the records in 1993. There are other statements in that second paragraph that don't seem quite right to me either.  

Not too late at all, there's no time when an article is considered """"finished"""".  I did notice that some dates are missing, like the TCCP you mentioned.  You might want to consider rewriting it and then posting it on here before making the changes to the article since that seems to be working to prevent edit-wars. .:..:. babelfish 

In response to the """"others"""" statement that over 50% of the existing ISSR breeders left in '97-98, at Tina's request, I have reviewed the database and put it into a live web page that can be shared with the entire Shiloh fancy.  http://www.shilohshepherds.info/otherBreeders.htm.

I am also preparing other documented data pages that will clearly dispell the objections that have been raised by the """"other"""" """"editors"""".

Regarding """"wars argument"""" - thanks, I will do that soon.
Here is my thinking, Krugman's criticism is mentioned 8 times in a article. It is intellectual dishonesty (and one  of character) to loudly criticize one school of thought and than refuse to even debate for an hour with an actual austrian economist; where he has debated with politicians """"to boost his book sales"""" in his own words. So if his critic is in any way or form relevant, why not settle it once for all and end with austrians, or if he doesn't want to lose his time on irrelevant things, he has humanitarian incentive (or why call out austrians in a first place?)...  So all in all, it comes to this, either criticizer and critic is irrelevant and should be deleted, or what is in my opinion far better solution, this discrepancy should be there for readers to know and decide for themselves. This could be done in one or two sentences, just a note that he refuses the offer of debate from 2010 although 105 000$ fund for Food bank New York was established; + a link to site.

""": Hi Sunray  That is an interesting question. The article has had a """"peer review"""" by several Deming scholars and consultants who were in Deming's inner circle. They like the article and had few suggestions on issues/problems of content. One is looking into several minor details and will report back to me. If we move sections of the article to sub articles it may help the article become a GA or FA but will make the article less educational because the sections we will move to sub articles are the most important for understanding Deming's philosophy. So the question is should we do that or leave it and polish areas of the article through copy editing? One Swedish Deming scholar intends to translate the article for Swedish Wikipedia and encouraged others to do the sane for their language versions.

Rick, next time you're on I-5 can you check to see if the signs say """"Los Banos"""" or """"Los Baños"""" (per my one-sided discussion at Talk:Los Banos, California). Send me an email () if you just wanna lurk.  Thanks.   |  Talk 22:08, July 19, 2005 (UTC)
Vandal activity down since you left
Rick, it's interesting to note that since you left, vandalism on Wikipedia has gone down. It's clear that you and those like you simply act to frustrate and abuse legitimate users, whose angry responses can be classed as vandalism, giving you an increased sense of self importance. We don't need that, we need more quality editors, not more volunteer vigilantes.  
That's the biggest absurd I've ever heard. 
Indeed; it is my impression there is considerably more vandalism now. The edits of the sockuppet above would be one small example. (talk) 
Indeed.  I've blocked more in the last day than in the previous 18 months as an admin, which can only be due to the """"RickK and Heph gap"""". Complaining about RickK and Heph is like having an allergy and wishing you didn't have an immune system.   |  Talk 18:40, July 20, 2005 (UTC)

I find it hard to believe one editor (even one so prolific as RickK) can have much of an effect overall. Do contributors on either side have any (non-anecdotal) evidence that suggests otherwise?  Pete 
If memory serves, Angela did a survey a while back (Feb or March of 2004) where she sampled the number of blocks each admin had given. Rickk had almost as many as the next 3 people combined.  19:19, July 20, 2005 (UTC)
Personally? I frequently saw his edits, and he left a useful note on my talk page correcting me for something.  

Isn't it obvious to everyone?  RickK created a whole entourage of sockpuppets, then vandalised with them, then blocked them.  Just to fulfill his self-aggrandising dreams.  He made fools of us all, just to prove that he was brilliant.  Don't you hate him?  Kill RickK, kill RickK, kill RickK'''!  

I can safely say that ever since RickK's departure, I have been faced with reverting five times the vandalism I did prior, which still dosen't come close to his legendary vandal fighting, troll combatting, and trash disposing.  
Nonsense! I wish him and his many sockpuppets stay out!  

To Raul654, now that I can believe ). Statistics on the effect of handing out bans liberally would be great to have.  Pete 

My experience in the Wikiworld has shown RickK to be abusive of other users, authoritarian, consistently reverting other peoples edits without apparent reason and unwilling to join a debate on a given subject when his arguments were confronted. Personally, Im glad he gave up.

"""The """"Gdansk vote"""" - a discussion that took place freakin' fifteen years ago is completely irrelevant. It is not nor ever was policy or even a guideline. The appropriate guideline is Wikipedia's naming convention and manual of style. Did Wikipedia even have infoboxes when the Gdansk discussion took place? If not then how can it possibly apply to that. Did the sources change in the fifteen freakin' years since the Gdansk discussion? If so, then that's an additional reason not to care about it.

If you think that you can hide behind the Gdansk vote in order to carry out your edit wars, or to engage in nationalistic POV pushing, that's your prerogative. I very strongly doubt that others will see it the same way.

The Real World: Miami BLP issue
If the anonymous IP editor was indeed the cast member of that show in person, then they should've contacted me, or anyone on Wikipedia to address this matter in an open, transparent manner. By instead removing the material which was sourced to the very network on which that show aired, and making no attempt to respond my messages on the IP's talk page, that person left me with little choice; I acted in good faith, and my actions were completely legitimate. Many times when photographing public events for WP and the Commons, I have happily aided BLP subjects who have requested my help in addressing problems with their articles. This includes contacting Community Liaison Maggie Dennis, and Jimmy Wales himself, most recent regarding the Toure matter, for example. But if the person removes sourced material from an IP account and makes no efforts to respond to my messages, my hands are tied. In your view, I should just assume that when an IP editor removes sourced content, that oh, I should assume that it's the actual subject, which is silly. Equally silly is your position that MTV is """"flimsy"""", when the article in question is about a show on MTV, and the source is the bio pages about cast members on their website.

""""Force Rectifying"""" angular accelerations to produce linear acceleration as a """"footloose"""" example of """"tractoring"""" on the """"Zero Point Field"""" has actual physical examples to give it credence, but the intolerance of science as a religion prevents rational debate, and examination.

While the """"Aether"""" was discredited because it did NOT conform to our definition of a classical gas, the Zero Point Field (Rueda, Puthoff, and Haisch), describes a coupling of baryonic matter with it's surroundings.

If you look closely at the diffs or at the IP address contribution history, you'll see that this IP editor changed the anon IP sig to two different user names. Both of the registered users, Tomananda and Samuel Luo, are very active on the Falun Gong-related articles and have participated in many different surveys and straw polls.

Fat is never converted to Glc, not at least in humans according to the textbooks.  

Let me add few things. First, Glc enters/leaves the cell through a proces called facilitated diffusion. Which means that as soon as the Glc concentration inside the cell is somehow increased, Glc will start leaving the cell - which by the way happens in hepatocytes during glycogenolysis. Second, even if there was a way to keep Glc inside the cell, say through active transport, Glc poses a danger to the cell integrity as Glc is a highly osmotically active compound. The cell solves these two issues with a single solution by synthesizing glycogen from Glc - the enormous glycogen molecules can't leave the cell, and by having osmotically inert glycogen instead of Glc, the cell avoids the osmotic shock.  13:55, 30",0

"Here are my thoughts on the questions you've posed:
Which of the places on the list are notable enough for separate articles (if they don't have one now)?  I've added links to articles where I could them.  I'd say articles are also needed at least for Sugar Creek,  Red Butte, Rocky Ridge, Echo Canyon, and Emigration Canyon.  A couple of points of interest that could be added are Genoa, Nebraska (settled by the Latter-day Saints as a supply point) and This Is The Place Heritage Park.  I'm sure other landmarks will be identified with additional research.
Which places could be reasonably combined in sections, like the eastern Wyoming sites? Some suggested sections:  Iowa (mostly covering the 1840s); the Missouri River area (Winter Quarters / Kanesville / Florence); Missouri River to Fort Laramie; For Laramie to Fort Bridger (with a focus on the handcart companies); and Fort Bridger to Salt Lake Valley.  The Iowa section could include a brief subsection on the route used by the handcart companies from Iowa City to Florence.
And how are we to deal with elapsed time, as early companies had different experiences than later companies?  One chunk for geography and another for linear time? I think the organization of the Mormon Trail article should focus on geography.  Content that is intrinsically chronological could be moved to the Mormon Pioneer article.  Would it make sense to tackle both of these articles at once to try to ensure that they compliment each other without simply being repetitive?—",0
"Impact of recent student edits

This article has recently been edited by students as part of their course work for a university course.  As part of the quality metrics for the education program, we would like to determine what level of burden is placed on Wikipedia's editors by student coursework.

If you are an editor of this article who spent time correcting edits to it made by the students, please tell us how much time you spent on cleaning up the article.  Please note that we are asking you to estimate only the negative effects of the students' work.  If the students added good material but you spent time formatting it or making it conform to the manual of style, or copyediting it, then the material added was still a net benefit, and the work you did improved it further.  If on the other hand the students added material that had to be removed, or removed good material which you had to replace, please let us know how much time you had to spend making those corrections. This includes time you may have spent posting to the students' talk pages, or to Wikipedia noticeboards, or working with them on IRC, or any other time you spent which was required to fix problems created by the students' edits. Any work you did as a Wikipedia Ambassador for that student's class should not be counted.

Please rate the amount of time spent as follows:
 0 -No unproductive work to clean up
 1 - A few minutes of work needed
 2 - Between a few minutes and half an hour of work needed

For example, look at the signature of my posting above...  it has been mysteriously changed to read incorrectly as: 76.69.162.155 (talk

Also, I like the way the first paragraph in the article has shaped up.  But it now says that the names Harris Levey signed his Air Wave artwork with were """"pseudonyms"""".  IN fact, during that time, just before joining DC comics, Harris Levey legally changed his name to """"Leland Harris"""", and most often signed his work as """"Lee Harris"""" and on occasion """"Leland Harris"""". He changed his name back (legally) to Harris Levey around 1953, just before marriage.  The spelling """"Harris Levy"""" (with only one """"e"""" in the last name) seems to have been the way comic book databases and historians have referred to Lee Harris (the Air Wave illustrator) in their writings.

OldLady Productions was created in 2007, by their first 2 actors Ryan and Marco. They created OldLady Productions after their first video """" Soccer Battle 2 """".
OldLady Productions then went up to a cast of 5 people. About a year later OldLady Productions fired to of their members ( Daniel and Steven ) and got to new actors ( Marino and Gianni ).
Their most viewed video on youtube was their """" Camp Rock Parody """" video with over 125 000 views after 3 months that it was uploaded. This was a big break for them because 
they never imagined getting anywhere close to that amount of views. Although in reality it is not that many views, for a new video company it was fantastic.

Videos 

We do not know that exact amount of videos that OldLady Productions has due to the fast that they are still under construction. Here are a list of videos we are sure they have released

- Hero Movie
- THE FIGHT OF A LIFETIME ! ! ! ! !
- Ryan V.S Marco
- Nothing
- Fashion Show 08

- Detective Movie
- Camp Rock
- How to be a bro !
- Music Battle 2008
- Never Back Down ( training video ) * Parody *
- Chriss Angel
- James Bond

These movies were done for amusement purposes, before OldLady Productions commenced their actual company videos. OldLady productions is planning to create and unveil new and improved movies, starting with * Soccer Battle 3 * You may only be able to see all these videos on the official OldLady productions website. Most of these videos will not be on youtube because they are starting their big outbreak with Soccer Battle 3.

 Lying comes too easily to you Mr.Kannambadi 

Mr.Kannambadi, 

Do you know that your attitude is also an equal put off to those who wish to contribute genuinely to wikipedia, engage in healthy discussions and arguments?  It is obvious that trusting you to be sincere in your approach and thinking you to be respectful of fellow contributors, I come up with explanation, sometimes or many a times in detail about historical events. Mind you the expression detailed in victory and silent about defeats was the one given not by me but by you to Nishkid. 

Also, do not resort to blatant lying on these pages (which you are clearly doing, first by saying that I have no sources - be realized that others can also read and write - and second, you are deliberately with malafide intentions creating a misimpression in wikipedia that I was banned for abusing and lack of sources. Be informed that it was neither of those reasons, because the first time I was blocked by Blinguen, it was completely and absolutely without any reason and the second time Blinguen came into my page, he did not express any objections to my contributions or changes to the Chola page, but first he commented that he is blocking me for he thought my contributions were my personal opinions and because he blocked me, he first of all did not engage in any discussions with me or try to explain as to how to make postings in the right manner (though I had indeed sourced the material properly but had not referenced the same) with the result that I got blocked before getting to discuss or even adding the necessary references or citations.  But it is good, this way you are only exposing yourself displaying your lack of spirit of accommodation.

I think I have put it as succinctly as one can, but what can you do, you will go on yapping I am writing detailed messages and creating confusion and what not?  Do you remember the manner in which you so very contemptuously retorted upon my providing even the weblinks like visitchitradurga.com, unnecessarily resorting to instructing about keeping one’s patriotism under control…. That is the problem with people like you, when people give reasons you come up with such unhealthy excuses, when people want to discuss history instead of talking about sources and citations, you tell them to keep their patriotism under control or start alleging that what we try to contribute are devoid of sources or are straightaway our personal opinions. How wrong can you be?  Well, that’s how some people like you are in this world!!!

So your way is pretty clear; either avoid any discussion, remove postings and contributions or cry and complain behind the back, get people blocked and start blaming them by speaking and spreading all sorts of lies.

The next time you want to speak about somone abusing, pl. recall with all vigour in what manner you retorted to Mahawiki - you told him first not to """"soil"""" your talk page (what language and choice of words!!! and then you told him to go get the book by S.Kamat from a good library because you said such a library exists near your home..... if those are not insults, abusive manner of speaking, then what is.... but poor you, when I asked you to go and read Ancient India by either Roychowdhury or Sastri, you start looking out of the balcony!!!!!!

tsk tsk..

  

 Who is a vandal, Mr.Dinesh Kannambadi 

Do not accuse others of being vandals.  Because Ninlil's intervention did not seem partial to you, you have resorted to getting the page 'blocked from edits in the garb of it being an FA category (howsoever inaccurate' by Yellowmonkey.

Now whom should the question be asked: whether it is appropriate to mention the demise of the Cholas along with the demise of the Chalukyas, when it is clearly known to everyone that the Chalukyas first remained without a capital for over 30 years up to 1160/65 and finally demised in 1189/1192 AD with the Cholas lasting another 9 decades before being routed and finally eclipsed by the Pandiyans in 1279 AD?. This is simply because there is no relationship between the demise of the two kingdoms, the Cholas did not cause extinction of the Chalukyas or vice versa. The demise of the Chalukyas does not deserve mention in the Chola page because even though the Cholas existed, but mainly because the Chalukyas were consumed and finally eclipsed by their local rivals in Kannada country as well as by the Kakatiyas.  Then what could be the reason for mentioning the demise of the Cholas, when it was the Chalukyas who demised many, many years before them? Is it some sort of a new version of history that is being sought to be told and spread to unsuspecting visitors to these pages?

 PREP vs. Quick Count 

The text of the article suggests (and states overtly at least once) that the PREP and the Quick Count are the same thing. They are most definitely not. 

The Quick Count (""""Conteo Rapido"""", as opposed to the PREP, """"Programa the Resultados Electorales Preliminares""""), was a statistical sampling model of several polling places. It was meant as a statistical tool of prediction. The results from the Quick Count, which were made public some days later, showed that the statistical tests showed Calderon as winning in all three, but in two of them the difference was within the margin of error and in the third it was only barely outside. It was because of this, as per prior agreement, that the IFE declared the race too close to call (the prior agreement was that the IFE would either state which candidate was projected to be the winner based on the Conteo Rapido, or ask for a couple more hours to collate more results, or declare the race too close to call). The Quick Count was not the PREP. As it happens, the final tally agreed with the Quick Count results.

The PREP on the other hand is the quick dissemination of full results as reported by the district electoral councils to the IFE. There is no statistical component to the PREP, as opposed to the Quick Count which is an entirely statistical analysis of results.

See for example , in which Ugalde speaks of making the results from the Quick Count known, and whether the tecnical committee felt it would be possible to determine the electoral tendencies at the time.  Another note is in:

The above is not acceptable mainly because bitcoins are not solely exchanged between computers. That is not how the system operates entirely and it's in fact and understatement to the networking technology. A bitcoin transaction is simply signing the bitcoin address of another and transferring the coins. You can do that with any device. The website statement is misleading and implies people are trading bitcoins out of a library. That is not why these websites exist and you will need a citation for that claim.

"Reply to FyzixFighter 

FyzixFighter, you are making some of the same mistakes as Brews. You seem to think that we can take that four part expansion of acceleration in terms of polar coordinates and read some physics into it. We can't. The polar terms tell us nothing about any particular motion.

But they are nevertheless very useful. We can use the expressions in a properly modelled differential equation that involves real physical input. The radial convective term is used as a centrifugal force in the two body gravity problem.

You seem to think that because it is derived with a negative sign that it has to mean centripetal force. That is not so. The negative sign is a consequence of the outward positive convention for the position vector.

The expression is merely the mathematical form for a force that changes the direction of motion and acts in the radial direction.

When we construct the planetary orbital equation, we end up with a radial gravity force inwards and a centrifugal force radially outwards. We have a scalar equation in the radial length and the two forces equate to the second time derivative of the radial length. You have got too much bogged down in trivia over matters like whether or not the second time derivative of radial length is entitled to be termed radial acceleration or not.

It doesn't matter. Just concentrate on the equation and solve it. And in doing so, you will see that inward radial gravity is working in opposition to an ongoing outward radial centrifugal force.",0

Regarding the article, I have seen similar language used in many other wikipedia articles and so do not see why mine is such a huge problem. Since it was an edit to the first line, I don't think it would be appropriate to add more to that part of the article, as the logic behind the article is already within the rest of the article (record sales, changes. etc.) and it would look strange to discuss record sales and etc in the first line of the article, right?

I made such a minor edit to the article, and if there was any mistake, could he not have merely pointed out any errors to me as a newbie instead? Or does he have a problem with allowing newcomers to work on wikipedia as well and merely try to land them in trouble instead? I am not really sure why he is determined to complain about me no matter what edit I make, but his aggressive stance is clear, and if everyone were to behave this way towards newbies, I am sure wikipedia would become a very isolated place, which it is indeed not. I am open to anyone explaining how I can imp[rove my edits, but I am not open to being treated like a criminal - by this exact same one user - for every word I ever type on the site.

How to report Vandalism in Wikipedia 
Hello kashimjamed. 
As you probably see this member """"Nathanael-whatever"""" is a hypocrite and loves to act like a judge in here. Not only to me but to many other members of Wikipedia as well.

Many of his contributions in the wikipedia Zodiac pages are mostly based on his personal opinion and not based of what all Astrological community believes. He takes only certain lines from certain sources and twists everything according to his own personal belief. When something seems to contradict his own personal beliefs he just deletes it even if is based on a full reliable source according to the wikipedia rules.

Anyway just follow this link if you want to report him:

""":::::::Dictatorship of the status quo?!

Looking through the archives here, it seems that discussion of the article's name has almost entirely revolved around a suggested move to """"British India"""".  Clearly such a move would be outright wrong.  But that still leaves us with the problem that while """"British Raj"""" does seem to get usage as a name for the territories under the authority of the Governor-General in Council, it's also used as the name for a period (see the article lede at """"History of the British Raj"""" by way of example).  In other words, the term is ambiguous, and thus we keep having people here and elsewhere changing terms back and forth, and I don't see how that will change so long as that ambiguity remains.  That's why I think """"Indian Empire"""" is better; it's clearly about a country.  Alternatively, and I say this through slightly gritted teeth, we could have it at """"British Indian Empire"""".

As for usage by historians, surely they most commonly use the simple term """"India""""?  Which is not of course to say that other terms don't get used (especially in book titles).

"""==Subalpine Fir==
Hi Walter - thanks! very nice pics again -) I'm doing very little on wiki just at the mo, my computer seems set to expire, keeps on freezing in mid-type . . grrrr! (so if I disappear that's why). Nootka Cypress has been reclassified recently, you'll find it at Callitropsis nootkatensis now (the reasons for the change are outlined there) -  
Thank you. I've put Nootka Cypress in the proper category, now. I'm sorry to hear of your computer woes. Best wishes.  
Thanks! Been wondering - do you have any opinion on whether it would be better to have Subalpine Fir at one page or two?: the two species split used by Fl. N. Amer. is far from universally accepted (e.g. USDA don't accept it). I was thinking of (a) moving the present page to just 'Subalpine Fir', and (b) expanding on the one/two species discussion, to make a page similar to that for White Fir (also split into two species by Fl. N. Amer.), or the coverage of Alpine Spruce at Norway Spruce. Let me know what you think -  
I think that is a good proposal and support it. Pojar (op. cit.) does much the same and it works well. Coast Range Subalpine Fir and Rocky Mountains Subalpine Fir would be replaced by redirects to help those unfamiliar with the issue.
Will do, computer permitting! (just now, it seems to need 2 hours cool-off time for every half hour of working before it goes on the blink - yet a temperature indicator says it isn't overheating)
Hmmm - needs an admin to do it; I'll give Guettarda a buzz -   Addenum - Guettarda's done it now, I'll start working on the page -  
I thought the White Fir and Norway Spruce articles were very good.
Thanks! -)
Some redirects for the White Fir and Norway Spruce common names seem to be missing. Is this intentional?
No, my oversight - I'm forever forgetting to do all the necessary redirects. By all means add any you see missing!
Do you have plans to work on Abies amabilis anytime soon? It is the dominant mid-elevation species west of the Cascade crest in Washington, often with only small number of other individuals, mostly Thuja plicata and Tsuga heterophylia.
Yes, again computer permitting; for pics I've got a studio closeup of some foliage (useful to show the dense pubescence) but a pic or two (or three or four ...!) from the wild would be brilliant. Any options on getting cones, or is it a poor crop this year?
Your suggestions of image subjects from Washington are welcome.
Any are welcome! If there's lots, they can always go in ... format. Outsize trees are nice, but typical 'average' mature specimens are also perhaps better for an encyclopedia (I liked the Whitebark Pine pic in that respect), and shots of foliage + cones. Vine Maple would be good too, there's already a PD pic from the USDA, but it's very low res and could do with replacing, ditto for several other broadleaves too. And Taxus brevifolia (only very low res PD pic at the mo).
Best wishes,  
Thanks again! -  

Thank you for the image suggestions. I think that I can get some of them soon.
Thought of another - Grand Fir could do with a tree pic - 
Perhaps the giant tree images could go into a new article Giant Trees or something similar, eventually.
Someone else suggested that too, by moving the ==Champion trees== section out of Tree to its own page; it might be a good idea - 
Why not request admin status? I'd be happy to suggest it, if you prefer.  
Thanks! I may do yet, Guettarda is also suggesting it -

Hi Walter - done now, awaiting a pic for the taxobox and any more details I've omitted! -  
Excellent article. I like the illustrations you found, especially the closeup of the lower surface. I spent several hours looking through thousands of images without finding any that are suitable. Either the trees/foliage are incidental to the image or the identity of the species is uncertain. Now that I have a good reason to go on a photography expedition, the weather has turned bad. Snow is forecast down to 4 to 5000' in the next few days. It is our first significant storm of the fall. When it improves, I'll try to",0

 Squeak, in your add of the BLP, you wrote """"tag for BLP as this article has issues"""". Can you elaborate specifically what some of those issues are (preferably without commentary in in a short, concise, bulleted list)? That way we can together address those concerns.

"The old taxobox template? 
Hi!

I know you are busy with the cactus, but I hope you can help me out. On the Norwegian Wikipedia, we have since the beginning used a taxobox without ranks. This has been due to early influence from a single editor, which has since gone unchallenged until a year ago or so. Now, we finally have the consensus to change over to a ranked system, the only problem is that there seem to be no-one capable (or willing) of doing the coding of something as complex as a taxo-box. The bio-editors over at Norwegian WP are just just a handful of people, all of which seem to be as techically inclined as yours truly.

So, I had the bright idea to import and translate the old (non-auto) taxobox from English. I don't know anything about coding, but since the ranks are in latin, I suppose it should be possible to understand what bits need translation. The only problem is, I don't know how to find the code. Do you have access to it? If so, would it be possible for you to post the code on this test page?",0

These edits by two IPs resolving to Brisbane, Australia have been removed twice.   The text is ungrammatical, and unsupported by reliable sources.

 Estimate of total biomass is incorrect. 

The page defines biomass as:

""""Biomass is organic non-fossil material, collectively. In other words, 'biomass' describes the mass of all biological organisms, dead or alive...""""

and then goes on to state:

""""The entire earth contains about 75 billion tons of biomass.""""

Assuming 1 billion is 10^9, this estimate is too low to be consistent with the definition.

To give an example, in its """"Global Forest Resources Assessment 2000"""", the FAO estimates that the """"global total above-ground woody biomass was 422 billion tonnes""""

We seem to have had this discussion before, and considering that it is a minor change, this should be easy to change. The article makes it clear that the comfort women were made up of both groups, if someone wants to give some figures relating to the numbers in each group, then it would be great.

Arbitration enforcement action appeal by Yossiea~enwiki

Procedural notes: The rules governing arbitration enforcement appeals are found here. According to the procedures, a """"clear, substantial, and active consensus of uninvolved editors"""" is required to overturn an arbitration enforcement action. To help determine any such consensus, involved editors may make brief statements in separate sections but should not edit the section for discussion among uninvolved editors. Editors are normally considered involved if they are in a current dispute with the sanctioning or sanctioned editor, or have taken part in disputes (if any) related to the contested enforcement action. Administrators having taken administrative actions are not normally considered involved for this reason alone (see WP:UNINVOLVED).

 Administrator imposing the sanction  

 Notification of that administrator  The appealing editor is asked to notify the administrator who made the enforcement action of this appeal, and then to replace this text with a diff of that notification. The appeal may not be processed otherwise. If a block is appealed, the editor moving the appeal to this board should make the notification.

Statement by Yossiea~enwiki

That was not a personal attack. Don't come in the middle of a discussion just because one person decides to complain, if that happened at all. If you want to chase people away from editing Wikipedia, that's a good way to do it.

Coat of Arms of the Kingdom of Ireland image is dubious

The image depicted of the Coat of Arms of the Kingdom of Ireland is ahistorical and a creation by its author based on his interpretation of a coat of arms motif that appears on The Custom House completed in 1791 in Dublin. While a gold harp on a blue shield with a crown surmounting the shield was sometimes used by the government in Ireland, the stonework on this building that portrays the shield of Ireland in a stylistic way with the supporters for England (a lion) and Scotland (a unicorn) is simply heraldic artwork and not a proper coat of arms of the said kingdom. The Kingdom of Ireland created by Henry VIII never had its own unique royal coat of arms. i.e. a full armorial achievement. After 1603 and the Union of the Crowns of England and Scotland, the royal arms of James I of England (James VI of Scotland) did include a harp for Ireland in the third quarter. the image in question is loosely based on the current UK royal arms. It was created by simply placing the shield for Ireland as the sole shield and retaining the Order of the Garter collar, St Edward's Crown, supporters and royal motto of the current UK coat of arms (which is not in this depiction in its the full armorial achievement format as it is missing the helm, crest and compartment). It is noteworthy that the creator refers to the crown as the """"imperial crown"""" - which is anachronistic as there was no British Empire during the Kingdom of Ireland period. While I think the creator was sincere in thinking this was indeed the historical coat of arms for the Kingdom of Ireland from 1541 until the Act of Union 1801, Ireland - unlike Scotland - did not have its own royal coat of arms during this period. When the then Anglo-Irish parliament met for the last time before the Union of 1801, it did not request a separate royal coat of arms for use in Ireland as Scotland did almost a century before in the Act of Union 1707. If anyone has evidence to the contrary, I would be most interested to learn about it.   """,0

"Hi, Benne. Thank you for unearthing this need for disambiguation. I think that Mansura is usually spelled with a ta marbuta as its final letter: منصورة (manṣūrä). This comes frot the root نصر (naṣara) meaning 'help' or 'make victorious' (interestingly, in derived form II it means 'Christianize'). Therefore, منصور (manṣūr) means 'helped', 'supported', 'victorious'. The place name is the feminine version of this, perhaps representing the old accusative (with locative meaning). In Arabic, many place names begin with the definite article. Sometimes the article is kept in trasliteration and sometimes it isn't. Sometimes it's transliterated as Al and sometimes it's El. The word itself could be transliterated as Mansura, Mansoura, Mansoora, Mansurah, Mansourah, Mansoorah, Mansureh, Mansoureh, Mansooreh. It would make sense to have all of these alternatives, with and without alternatives of definite article, linking to a disambiguation page. However, the Egyptian Mansurah is by far the most important of these, so it might take precedence over the disambig. I'll see if I can tidy it up a little. —",0

Wikinews has started a series of interviews with noteworthy past Eurovision contestants, which will be published through May. So far  of our project has interviewed 1982 winner Nicole, 1973 winner Anne Marie David, two-time entrant Edsilia Rombley, and soon to be three-time entrant Chiara Siracusa.
 The backlog of assessments in the project is still ongoing, with a large number of articles not being rated. If you see articles without the  template on the article's talk page, please add it, or read Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Assessment if you would like to help assess the articles as well. With the help of , , and  in the past month, the assessment level has passed 50%!
 Remember to source all information you add to pages properly or else it may be removed, and always use an edit summary so other users know why you are adding or removing information.
 If you are going to make a page for a song in the contest, please make it more than a stub so it does not get deleted.

 From the Members
Welcome to the seventh edition of the WikiProject Eurovision newsletter! It has been a busy month full of national finals and homework for school, so I apologize for publishing the newsletter so late. 

The deadline for choosing the entries is right around the corner and following its passing, we will have a great opportunity to improve the quality of the articles in our project. There are many song stubs that have been created for the entries this year and I would like to see them expanded into coherent articles. Also, I think we need to take a look back at the """"Country in ESC 2009"""" articles because I have noticed that most of them are out of date and need to be updated. 

We need to focus more on quality these days instead of just adding new info wherever it fits. Our goals is not to jam as much info o",0

Her education is a grand hoax as is her degree from the University Of Chicago. Andrea James is another transsexual who thinks because she can hide her past life she can make up any all all of her credentials with the thought or fear that no one challenge the validity of them. So you will know if I was graduate of the University of Chicago I would have my diploma displayed on my website with my transcripts if some called my education a grand hoax. Ultimately Ms. James steadfastly refuses to prove that she is a graduate from the University Of Chicago and if she makes up lies of that nature than what can be true about any thing else she claims to have achieved? Andrea James where is the proof, lets see your degree and tran Pityscripts from the University Of Chicago.

Furthermore Andrea loves to use her web-sites as a whipping post to harm professionals reputations who will not bow to her perverted view point. With out one doubt Ms. James needs help but like a pathological liars she will fix it her self and damn the people she hurts. In a way you have to feel sorry for her, however you cannot forgive her crimes against her sisters and the community she claims to represent when she thinks nothing about harming a hard working professionals reputation. In reality what that boils down to is jealousy of the worst nature and her use vile """"Yellow Journalism"""" and evil deeds would make any sociopath proud"""". Andrea James gets an A+ for being a sociopath.

The real tragedy about Andrea James is her failure to admit when she is wrong and to keep on making the same mistake in front of every one because she thinks it will go away. Your wrong Andrea if you want respect and people to like you, than you need to learn that hurting people reputation will not make you any friends.

'New' articles

I'm intending to make separate articles for each class as already exist at the german wikipedia.

Main reasons are:
I didn't find half as much info as I wanted in the article - hence I want to expand them
If I expand this article for all the classes it might become very long.
I also found the non-numerical treatment of the classes a bit confusing.

Once these articles are made this article could act as a hub - (perhaps renamed """"DB V160 family"""" or similar), or the article could be deleted.

 Waterfalls 
Hamilton looks like an impressive place for waterfalls.  I""""ll certainly have to include it in my list of places to visit.  I can't speak for any of the areas in the Pacific Northwest (which is home to hundreds of high, impressive falls), in North Carolina, according to Kevin Adams' """"North Carolina Waterfalls: A Hiking and Photography Guide"""", our state is estimated to have around 1,000 - 1,500 falls in the state, most of them in Transylvania County, NC (aka """"The Land of Waterfalls"""").  Estimates are that TC contains between 400-500 """"major"""" waterfalls in an area slightly smaller than the City of Hamilton (390 sq mi versus Hamilton's 439 sq mi).  As for what you call """"major"""" - that's pretty much up to the viewer.  One man's gushing torrent is another man's damp spot on the side of a rock.  In TC, a major waterfall is usually considered at least 15-20' high - not including talus - or having enough current to be an obvious waterfall (such as Hooker Falls).

If you ever get the chance to visit NC, please do.  We've got a lot of beautiful, rugged country.  To this day, I get reports about new waterfalls discovered by people who are just now able to scamper through some of the roughest terrain the east coast has to offer.    

Part of the problem with defining the """"City with the most waterfalls"""" is that neither term is overly well defined.  """"City"""" can mean """"town limits"""" or """"Metropolitan Area"""" or any other of a dozen different definitions.  Then you have the problem with the exact definition of a waterfall.  Ergo, you have the problem.   

Trail in New Zealand
I don't know of another town with that many waterfalls.  However I do know that when it rains really heavily the valley that you walk up first on the Milford Track, has over 300 waterfalls. -

Waterfalls
Regarding the 100 waterfalls Hamilton, I am unaware of another city area with that many.  There are probably """"areas"""" with about that much, such as the Columbia River Gorge, but the exact number there I am ignorant of and they are not that many major ones.  Here on the Olympic Peninsula we have a number of falls, but it is a really large area and probably does not reach the density that you have indicated there in Hamilton.  However it must be noted that I am a amateur at this and am ignorant of much

 Conflict of Interest 

Pm_shef: This is an attempt to resolve the concerns that relate to your conduct on Wikipedia and the editing of articles that you are personally involved in.   

As you know, the official policy of Wikipedia, according to WP:NOT, is that Wikipedia is not a soapbox, and that editors should avoid contributing to articles that they are personally involved in. That doesn't mean that your edits have not been neutral; rather, it means that any editing at all of Vaughan Council-related articles is inappropriate, no matter what is written. 

Here is the fulltext, from WP:NOT: 

Wikipedia is not a soapbox
Wikipedia is not a soapbox, or a vehicle for propaganda and advertising. Therefore, Wikipedia articles are not:
Propaganda or advocacy of any kind. Of course, an article can report objectively about such things, as long as an attempt is made to approach a neutral point of view. You might wish to go to Usenet or start a blog if you want to convince people of the merits of your favorite views. You can also use Wikinfo which promotes a """"sympathetic point of view"""" for every article.
Self-promotion. The arbitration committee ruled on February 17, 2006 that: """"Editors should avoid contributing to articles about themselves or subjects in which they are personally involved, as it is difficult to maintain NPOV while doing so.""""  Creating overly abundant links and references to autobiographical articles, or to articles in which you have a personal stake, is similarly unacceptable. See Wikipedia:Autobiography and Wikipedia:Notability.
Advertising. Articles about companies and products are fine if they are written in an objective and unbiased style. Furthermore, all article topics must be third-party verifiable, so articles about very small """"garage"""" companies are not likely to be acceptable. External links to commercial organizations are acceptable if they can serve to identify major corporations associated with a topic (see finishing school for an example). Please note Wikipedia does not endorse any businesses and it does not set up affiliate programs. See also WP:CORP for a proposal on corporate notability.

RP, good point - it does say """"team that reached the final"""" (so, presumably, the team that won the semi-final?) but it goes on to discuss the team and players that played in Seville.

Hi Katie, I'd like to request an undelete on your recent deletion of this image (WP:CSD#F7). This is for two reasons:
 It's the masthead, and only, image of a biography on an important motorsport and motorboat figure. Our precedent is clearly that such images are considered to fall under fair-use. If the FUR wasn't up to scratch on the image, then WP:BEFORE clearly indicates that the FUR should be fixed, not the image deleted. I've seen an awful lot of these lately - images uploaded a few years ago (so probably the more important images) with FUR that was adequate at their time of upload are being purged because they don't meet todays practice, even though it's a trivial filing exercise to bring them up to standard. This hurts the encyclopedia project.
 Secondly, it wasn't notified anywhere on the article. There are templates for notifying this on the page, there's a talk: page too. Many people, myself included, have articles like this on their watch lists but we don't have every constituent image watched. Now whilst policy doesn't demand this, it would clearly be a helpful and appropriate action to place some notification onto the article, especially when it's the masthead that's under threat.

"""==Why I don't edit often anymore==

Back in the day I used to edit wikipedia on a fairly regular basis. One of the pages I edited was the eXile. One detractor of the eXile, Peter Ekman, was so pathologically obsessed with discrediting the periodical, that he would devote weeks at a time to blanking and otherwise vandalizing the eXile article while launching reckless accusations at everyone who """"defended"""" the eXile. Although many editors did our best to contain Mr. Ekman, eventually he wore me down. It just wasn't worth it spending my free time containing the vendetta of some aggrieved middle-aged jerk.

As a parting bow in my too-long Ekman drama, I wanted to post here a summary about Mr. Ekman's character and the original wiki text that prompted Mr. Ekman's crusade.

About Peter Ekman

Peter Ekman is the aforementioned hack journalist who crusaded against the eXile. But once upon a time Ekman actually had an impressive sounding job working as an editor for the Moscow Times and dispensing right-wing platitudes in the heart of the former communist empire. Moscow in the 90s was a place where failures didn't fail. And for a long time Ekman didn't fail, despite his total lack of social graces and limited intelligence. Eventually his columns attracted the ire of the fellow Moscow publication, the eXile.

Originally the eXile was planning only on criticizing Ekman's written work, but Ekman's response was righteous, menacing, and hinted at violence. So the eXile's added a personal detail: they included the account of a female employee who had been subjected to unwelcome sexual advances by Mr. Ekman. Mr. Ekman had groped the employee while inviting her to a weekend get-away while his Russian Bride was out of town. Ekman responded with the same witless ape-shit animosity that I have since personally witnessed many times on wikipedia. Ekman attempted to get the eXile banned from Johnson's Reading List by declaring the eXile was a fascist, neo-nazi periodical. Ekman's evidence for such nazi sympathies was a spoof fashion piece entitled """"The eXile's Third Reich Uniform of the Week,"""" in which a fictional gay fashion designer breathlessly reviewed the 1938 version of the Nazi Field Bishop uniform.

Eventually Ekman lost his position at the Moscow Times. Since then he's occasionally surfaced as a professor of finance at various 3rd rate universities and, of course, here on Wikipedia.

The following is an excerpt from the Wikipedia Article on the eXile that prompted Mr. Ekman's crusade:

Peter Ekman, Johnson's Russia List, and an Unsubtantiated Groping Allegation
In November 2000, in Issue #23 of The eXile, Matt Taibbi published a press review entitled Peter Ekman Groped Me.  The article ridiculed Ekman, then newly appointed editor of The Moscow Times, for his approach to the economic and political development of Russia.  Taibbi characterized this approach as high-handed, condescending, and arrogant, and went on to mock Ekman personally as a pompous hypocrite: """"Ekman has only one idea (""""Russia has a lot to learn from America""""), which he tries endlessly to sell and resell as a varied package of ribald wit and insight.""""  The article also ridiculed Ekman for describing himself as a """"financial educator,"""" and described him as having """"a head seemingly worn bald from improper use.""""  As a finishing touch, Taibbi recounted an as-yet unverified account of sexual advances made by Ekman to an eXile employee, made at late at night at the Garazh nightclub in Moscow during a visit from Ekman's mother-in-law.

Ekman responded by writing in to Johnson's Russia List to claim that """"the eXile is fascist and racist,""""  that """"every eXile issue contains unverifiable stories that smear someone's reputation,"""" that The eXile """"is associated with the fascist party of Eduard Limonov."""" The accusations of fascism were discounted by many in part because of the eXile's Jewish roots - Ames, along with the eXile's publisher, deputy editor and several contributors are all Jews - and because of the paper's satirical editorial bent. It remains unclear as to whether Ekman did in fact make advances toward an eXile employee, or who that employee may have been.

 Article in need of improvement 

A substantial part of the article,

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_impetus

concerns a """"tunnel experiment,"""" as proposed by Galileo in his Dialogo.

The article would clearly benefit by having it pointed out that, although it could be, the experiment has as yet not been performed. In its original form the idea is to have a tunnel dug through the Earth so that a test object (""""cannonball"""") can be dropped into it. This is, of course, impossible. But the same physical principles would be revealed by using laboratory-sized massive bodies instead. The experiment could be performed in an Earth-based laboratory or in an orbiting satellite.

Not sure the recent edit changing Tyler from """"Anarchist"""" to """"Nihilist"""" is accurate. Tyler certainly does have a ethos and creed, where as a nihilist does not. His creed can certainly be said to be destruction of the current culture and certainly retrograde in many respects, seeking to return to a simpler subsistence level of existence (i.e. hunter/gatherer) but he definitely has an established ethos and world-view. It is simply contrary to much of modern society. I posit that the edit should be reverted back to anarchist.  17:56, Apr 9, 2004 (UTC)

Reader's Digest, Jack/Joe
Hey, a few years ago I was reading a really old Reader's Digest and I swear I actually read an article written first person from an organ's point of view.  (I don't remember which.)

...and the guy's name was Joe.

This was before I read the book, so I just thought it was a really odd coincidence at the time...I can't seem to find the article anymore, though.  Does anyone else have any info on this?  Was Joe changed to Jack to avoid legal troubles with the original """"Joe's XXXXXX"""" author?

 The author of the book was talking about real stories from Reader's Digest, so you probably did read the same ones he refered to. """"Joe"""" is changed to """"Jack"""" in the movie because Reader's Digest wasn't willing to allow them to mention it in the film.  LGagnon

I have a copy of John Pekkanen's article """"I am John's Brain Tumour"""", from Reader's Digest (South Africa) 1990-12, volume 137, number 824. Chapter 7 of my copy of Palahniuk's Fight club has """"I am Jane's Uterus. I am Joe's Prostate. [...] I am totally Joe's Gallbladder"""", ISBN 0-099-28333-6, Vintage (1997) UK Random House. The English RD sites I searched came up empty. The earliet """"Joe""""s I found were two 1974 videos  from """"Pyramid Films"""". I found that """"Pyramid Media"""" credits it to RD . Does anyone have a source of an actual Reader's Digest article with """"Joe""""? - , 2004-04-15t22:37z

 It is mentioned on the commentary for the DVD that Reader's Digest told them not to use """"Joe"""". Apperantely they own the copyright somehow. Either way, the narrator in the book does use Joe rather than Jack. And given that the book is the original story, I believe that """"Joe"""" should be used more often in the article than """"Jack"""" (though """"the narrator"""" fits the character's """"name"""" more accurately). The article seems to lean too much towards being about the movie, which makes it seem as if it was the original source material instead of the book. It would be best that we keep the article based mainly on the book, with details on the movie where applicable. Otherwise, what we would be doing would be the equivelent of someone making the Lord of the Rings article more about the Peter Jackson movie than JRR Tolkien's work.  LGagnon

Tyler section
We should merge the Tyler Durden section into the characters section. There isn't a need for 2 separate sections on him. As it is it looks redundant and a bit sloppy. Any details that don't fit that section can go into a different one.  LGagnon

Backstory of the novel
I just recently updated the article on Chuck Palahniuk with info on how Fight Club came to be. This is in the first paragraph of the Biography section. I was wondering if anyone thought we should include that info in this article, since it gives the backstory of how it was written.   Talk]] 12:00, 27 Jul 2004 (UTC)

Movie & Book Balance
As I mentioned above at the end of the Reader's Digest, Jack/Joe section, the article is """"biased"""" towards the movie (that is, the info for the film is treated as being the primary source instead of the book), and needs to be balanced equally for the book. I have fixed a recent re-write of the plot section (which made it even more biased in favor of the film), but more work could be done to balance the article. I think that fixing this is the most important o",0

"Context of the Women's Health Movement 
I think it is important to note the context of which Carol Downer figured out how to do vaginal self-exam and menstrual extraction during the woman’s health movement at this time, the early 1970’s, abortion, birth control and fertility information were not available to women. In addition, there were an estimated 5000 deaths a year from illegal abortion. This concept helped put reproduction and the woman’s body back into the hands of the woman in a safe way. I also feel as though some of the language used in this article has a negative connotation. For example, when it is stated that she “promoted a procedure called menstrual extraction... if she were pregnant, this would constitute a non-professional abortion.” it sounds as if the article is trying to claim that she promoted abortions, which isn’t necessarily true. What she did promote was women reclaiming their bodies and taking them out of the hands of the male-dominated medical world and into their own. She PROVIDED women with means to learn about their bodies at a time where birth control did not exist. I also think it should be noted that after Roe v. Wade, she traveled to Europe, Canada, New Zealand and Mexico, to name a few, and attended national and international conferences as advocates of women’s health rights. In addition, I think it should be specified what the Roe v. Wade decision entailed, and how it made abortion legalized so she was therefore able to establish the women-run clinics. Roe v. Wade has a Wikipedia article and can be linked. 

These contributions are important because the context all of this was a very important time in Women’s Health History. Mentioning the context of the women’s health movement and how she was providing women with the means to take control of their fertility and reproduction when they had no other means to do so and could even face legal persecutions if they did. By adding this, the article will make more sense, especially because it mentions her arrest and things like the Roe v. Wade trial.

From an ES/WGS perspective, the revolutionary time where woman began to take back the control of their bodies. There are many misconceptions around things like abortion even still today. Woman have been criminalized for performing or having abortions in history and even today. And I think it is important to take note of that. Also, Carol Downer has played such a crucial role in Women’s Health and Feminist activism, I was surprised at how short her article was. I also think that The Women’s Health Movement should have it’s own article on Wikipedia (currently there is “Feminist health centers” and “Women’s Health” and “Feminist Movement”)",0

Hello, , and thank you for contributing to Wikipedia!

I hope not to seem unfriendly or make you feel unwelcome, but I noticed your username, and am concerned that it might not meet Wikipedia's username policy. After you look over that policy, could we discuss that concern here?

I'd appreciate learning your own views, for instance your reasons for wanting this particular name, and what alternative username you might accept that avoids raising this concern.

You have several options freely available to you:
 If you can relieve my concern through discussing it here, I can stop worrying about it.
 If the two of us can't agree here, we can ask for help through Wikipedia's dispute resolution process, such as asking for a """"third opinion"""", or requesting comments from other Wikipedians. Admins usually abide by agreements reached through this process.
 You can keep your contributions history under a new username. Visit Wikipedia:Changing username and follow the guidelines there.

Let me reassure you that my writing here means I don't think your username is grossly, blatantly, or obviously inappropriate; such names get reported straight to Wikipedia:Administrator intervention against vandalism (WP:AIV), or blocked on sight. This is more a case where opinions might differ, and it would be good to reach some consensus — either here or at WP:RFC/NAME. So I look forward to a friendly discussion, and to enjoying your continued participation on Wikipedia. Thank you again!   Talk   """,0

"""

Thank you. My problem was with labeling Achilles a """"sexual predator."""" Presumably Sommerstein will go on to identifying Daedaluas as the first aviator and Andromache as the first feminist. Without in any way denying the existence of sexual predation then and now, this particular use of the phrase strikes me as homophobic. It raises the question, which other (nonmurderous) sexual predators he is thinking of? Solon? Socrates? Aeschines? I can only view it as a homophobic remark directed at the Greeks in general. If so, that raises questions about the propriety of repeating it here.

To add to that, what information do we have on the respective ages of the two? Am I mistaken or was Troilus described as a boupais? It has been a while since I studied the topic, but I seem to recall he was nineteen when he died, one year short of the magic twenty needed to save Troy. Achilles, on the other hand, was sixteen when he shed his female garb and left with Oedipus to join the battle, I believe. And the killing is said to have happened early in the war. So what can Sommerstein be editorializing about? An adolescent preying upon an adult?

On a separate note, I never saw anything claiming that Achilles fell in love with Polyxena at the same time as with Troilus. Everything points to his lying in wait at the Lion fountain expressly to get the boy, not the girl (though it may be significant that she was sacrificed by the Greeks at his tomb).

One more thing - when the brothers (which ones?) of Troilus ride - too late - to his rescue, Achilles meets them in Apollo's temple with an unusual weapon: Troilus' head, which he is swinging around by the hair. It is such a gory detail, it would be a pity to not include it, I just no longer have the sources.  """,0
